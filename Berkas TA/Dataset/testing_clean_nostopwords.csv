  2|  1| alif lam meem
  2|  2| thi is the book about which there is no doubt a guidanc for those consciou of allah
  2|  3| who believ in the unseen establish prayer and spend out of what we have provid for them
  2|  4| and who believ in what ha been reveal to you o muhammad and what wa reveal befor you and of the hereaft they are certain in faith
  2|  5| those are upon right guidanc from their lord and it is those who are the success
  2|  6| inde those who disbeliev it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believ
  2|  7| allah ha set a seal upon their heart and upon their hear and over their vision is a veil and for them is a great punish
  2|  8| and of the peopl are some who say we believ in allah and the last day but they are not believ
  2|  9| they think to deceiv allah and those who believ but they deceiv not except themselv and perceiv it not
  2| 10| in their heart is diseas so allah ha increas their diseas and for them is a pain punish becaus they habitu use to lie
  2| 11| and when it is said to them do not caus corrupt on the earth they say we are but reform
  2| 12| unquestion it is they who are the corrupt but they perceiv it not
  2| 13| and when it is said to them believ as the peopl have believ they say should we believ as the foolish have believ unquestion it is they who are the foolish but they know it not
  2| 14| and when they meet those who believ they say we believ but when they are alon with their evil one they say inde we are with you we were onli mocker
  2| 15| but allah mock them and prolong them in their transgress while they wander blindli
  2| 16| those are the one who have purchas error in exchang for guidanc so their transact ha brought no profit nor were they guid
  2| 17| their exampl is that of one who kindl a fire but when it illumin what wa around him allah took away their light and left them in dark so they could not see
  2| 18| deaf dumb and blind so they will not return to the right path
  2| 19| or it is like a rainstorm from the sky within which is dark thunder and lightn they put their finger in their ear against the thunderclap in dread of death but allah is encompass of the disbeliev
  2| 20| the lightn almost snatch away their sight everi time it light the way for them they walk therein but when dark come over them they stand still and if allah had will he could have taken away their hear and their sight inde allah is over all thing compet
  2| 21| o mankind worship your lord who creat you and those befor you that you may becom righteou
  2| 22| he who made for you the earth a bed spread out and the sky a ceil and sent down from the sky rain and brought forth therebi fruit as provis for you so do not attribut to allah equal while you know that there is noth similar to him
  2| 23| and if you are in doubt about what we have sent down upon our servant muhammad then produc a surah the like thereof and call upon your wit other than allah if you should be truth
  2| 24| but if you do not and you will never be abl to then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stone prepar for the disbeliev
  2| 25| and give good tide to those who believ and do righteou deed that they will have garden in paradis beneath which river flow whenev they are provid with a provis of fruit therefrom they will say thi is what we were provid with befor and it is given to them in like and they will have therein purifi spous and they will abid therein etern
  2| 26| inde allah is not timid to present an exampl that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it and those who have believ know that it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbeliev they say what did allah intend by thi as an exampl he mislead mani therebi and guid mani therebi and he mislead not except the defiantli disobedi
  2| 27| who break the coven of allah after contract it and sever that which allah ha order to be join and caus corrupt on earth it is those who are the loser
  2| 28| how can you disbeliev in allah when you were lifeless and he brought you to life then he will caus you to die then he will bring you back to life and then to him you will be return
  2| 29| it is he who creat for you all of that which is on the earth then he direct himself to the heaven hi be abov all creation and made them seven heaven and he is know of all thing
  2| 30| and mention o muhammad when your lord said to the angel inde i will make upon the earth a success author they said will you place upon it one who caus corrupt therein and shed blood while we declar your prais and sanctifi you allah said inde i know that which you do not know
  2| 31| and he taught adam the name all of them then he show them to the angel and said inform me of the name of these if you are truth
  2| 32| they said exalt are you we have no knowledg except what you have taught us inde it is you who is the know the wise
  2| 33| he said o adam inform them of their name and when he had inform them of their name he said did i not tell you that i know the unseen aspect of the heaven and the earth and i know what you reveal and what you have conceal
  2| 34| and mention when we said to the angel prostrat befor adam so they prostrat except for ible he refus and wa arrog and becam of the disbeliev
  2| 35| and we said o adam dwell you and your wife in paradis and eat therefrom in eas and abund from wherev you will but do not approach thi tree lest you be among the wrongdoer
  2| 36| but satan caus them to slip out of it and remov them from that condit in which they had been and we said go down all of you as enemi to one anoth and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provis for a time
  2| 37| then adam receiv from hi lord some word and he accept hi repent inde it is he who is the accept of repent the merci
  2| 38| we said go down from it all of you and when guidanc come to you from me whoever follow my guidanc there will be no fear concern them nor will they griev
  2| 39| and those who disbeliev and deni our sign those will be companion of the fire they will abid therein etern

  2| 42| and do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know it
  2| 43| and establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow in worship and obedi
  2| 44| do you order righteous of the peopl and forget yourselv while you recit the scriptur then will you not reason
  2| 45| and seek help through patienc and prayer and inde it is difficult except for the humbl submiss to allah
  2| 46| who are certain that they will meet their lord and that they will return to him
  2| 47| o children of israel rememb my favor that i have bestow upon you and that i prefer you over the world
  2| 48| and fear a day when no soul will suffic for anoth soul at all nor will intercess be accept from it nor will compens be taken from it nor will they be aid
  2| 49| and recal when we save your forefath from the peopl of pharaoh who afflict you with the worst torment slaughter your newborn son and keep your femal aliv and in that wa a great trial from your lord
  2| 50| and recal when we part the sea for you and save you and drown the peopl of pharaoh while you were look on
  2| 51| and recal when we made an appoint with mose for forti night then you took for worship the calf after him while you were wrongdoer
  2| 52| then we forgav you after that so perhap you would be grate
  2| 53| and recal when we gave mose the scriptur and criterion that perhap you would be guid
  2| 54| and recal when mose said to hi peopl o my peopl inde you have wrong yourselv by your take of the calf for worship so repent to your creator and kill yourselv that is best for all of you in the sight of your creator then he accept your repent inde he is the accept of repent the merci
  2| 55| and recal when you said o mose we will never believ you until we see allah outright so the thunderbolt took you while you were look on
  2| 56| then we reviv you after your death that perhap you would be grate
  2| 57| and we shade you with cloud and sent down to you manna and quail say eat from the good thing with which we have provid you and they wrong us not but they were onli wrong themselv
  2| 58| and recal when we said enter thi citi and eat from it wherev you will in eas and abund and enter the gate bow humbl and say reliev us of our burden we will then forgiv your sin for you and we will increas the doer of good in good and reward
  2| 59| but those who wrong chang those word to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon those who wrong a punish from the sky becaus they were defiantli disobey
  2| 60| and recal when mose pray for water for hi peopl so we said strike with your staff the stone and there gush forth from it twelv spring and everi peopl knew it water place eat and drink from the provis of allah and do not commit abus on the earth spread corrupt
  2| 61| and recal when you said o mose we can never endur one kind of food so call upon your lord to bring forth for us from the earth it green herb and it cucumb and it garlic and it lentil and it onion mose said would you exchang what is better for what is less go into ani settlement and inde you will have what you have ask and they were cover with humili and poverti and return with anger from allah upon them that wa becaus they repeatedli disbeliev in the sign of allah and kill the prophet without right that wa becaus they disobey and were habitu transgress
  2| 62| inde those who believ and those who were jew or christian or sabean befor prophet muhammad those among them who believ in allah and the last day and did righteous will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concern them nor will they griev
  2| 63| and recal when we took your coven o children of israel to abid by the torah and we rais over you the mount say take what we have given you with determin and rememb what is in it that perhap you may becom righteou
  2| 64| then you turn away after that and if not for the favor of allah upon you and hi merci you would have been among the loser
  2| 65| and you had alreadi known about those who transgress among you concern the sabbath and we said to them be ape despis
  2| 66| and we made it a deterr punish for those who were present and those who succeed them and a lesson for those who fear allah
  2| 67| and recal when mose said to hi peopl inde allah command you to slaughter a cow they said do you take us in ridicul he said i seek refug in allah from be among the ignor
  2| 68| they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is mose said allah say it is a cow which is neither old nor virgin but median between that so do what you are command
  2| 69| they said call upon your lord to show us what is her color he said he say it is a yellow cow bright in color pleas to the observ
  2| 70| they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is inde all cow look alik to us and inde we if allah will will be guid
  2| 71| he said he say it is a cow neither train to plow the earth nor to irrig the field one free from fault with no spot upon her they said now you have come with the truth so they slaughter her but they could hardli do it
  2| 72| and recal when you slew a man and disput over it but allah wa to bring out that which you were conceal
  2| 73| so we said strike the slain man with part of it thu doe allah bring the dead to life and he show you hi sign that you might reason
  2| 74| then your heart becam harden after that be like stone or even harder for inde there are stone from which river burst forth and there are some of them that split open and water come out and there are some of them that fall down for fear of allah and allah is not unawar of what you do
  2| 75| do you covet the hope o believ that they would believ for you while a parti of them use to hear the word of allah and then distort the torah after they had understood it while they were know
  2| 76| and when they meet those who believ they say we have believ but when they are alon with one anoth they say do you talk to them about what allah ha reveal to you so they can argu with you about it befor your lord then will you not reason
  2| 77| but do they not know that allah know what they conceal and what they declar
  2| 78| and among them are unlett one who do not know the scriptur except in wish think but they are onli assum
  2| 79| so woe to those who write the scriptur with their own hand then say thi is from allah in order to exchang it for a small price woe to them for what their hand have written and woe to them for what they earn
  2| 80| and they say never will the fire touch us except for a few day say have you taken a coven with allah for allah will never break hi coven or do you say about allah that which you do not know
  2| 81| ye whoever earn evil and hi sin ha encompass him those are the companion of the fire they will abid therein etern
  2| 82| but they who believ and do righteou deed those are the companion of paradis they will abid therein etern
  2| 83| and recal when we took the coven from the children of israel enjoin upon them do not worship except allah and to parent do good and to rel orphan and the needi and speak to peopl good word and establish prayer and give zakah then you turn away except a few of you and you were refus
  2| 84| and recal when we took your coven say do not shed each other blood or evict one anoth from your home then you acknowledg thi while you were wit
  2| 85| then you are those same one who are kill one anoth and evict a parti of your peopl from their home cooper against them in sin and aggress and if they come to you as captiv you ransom them although their evict wa forbidden to you so do you believ in part of the scriptur and disbeliev in part then what is the recompens for those who do that among you except disgrac in worldli life and on the day of resurrect they will be sent back to the severest of punish and allah is not unawar of what you do
  2| 86| those are the one who have bought the life of thi world in exchang for the hereaft so the punish will not be lighten for them nor will they be aid
  2| 87| and we did certainli give mose the torah and follow up after him with messeng and we gave jesu the son of mari clear proof and support him with the pure spirit but is it not that everi time a messeng came to you o children of israel with what your soul did not desir you were arrog and a parti of messeng you deni and anoth parti you kill
  2| 88| and they said our heart are wrap but in fact allah ha curs them for their disbelief so littl is it that they believ
  2| 89| and when there came to them a book from allah confirm that which wa with them although befor they use to pray for victori against those who disbeliev but then when there came to them that which they recogn they disbeliev in it so the curs of allah will be upon the disbeliev
  2| 90| how wretch is that for which they sold themselv that they would disbeliev in what allah ha reveal through their outrag that allah would send down hi favor upon whom he will from among hi servant so they return have earn wrath upon wrath and for the disbeliev is a humili punish
  2| 91| and when it is said to them believ in what allah ha reveal they say we believ onli in what wa reveal to us and they disbeliev in what came after it while it is the truth confirm that which is with them say then whi did you kill the prophet of allah befor if you are inde believ
  2| 92| and mose had certainli brought you clear proof then you took the calf in worship after that while you were wrongdoer
  2| 93| and recal when we took your coven and rais over you the mount say take what we have given you with determin and listen they said instead we hear and disobey and their heart absorb the worship of the calf becaus of their disbelief say how wretch is that which your faith enjoin upon you if you should be believ
  2| 94| say o muhammad if the home of the hereaft with allah is for you alon and not the other peopl then wish for death if you should be truth
  2| 95| but they will never wish for it ever becaus of what their hand have put forth and allah is know of the wrongdoer
  2| 96| and you will sure find them the most greedi of peopl for life even more than those who associ other with allah one of them wish that he could be grant life a thousand year but it would not remov him in the least from the come punish that he should be grant life and allah is see of what they do
  2| 97| say whoever is an enemi to gabriel it is none but he who ha brought the quran down upon your heart o muhammad by permiss of allah confirm that which wa befor it and as guidanc and good tide for the believ
  2| 98| whoever is an enemi to allah and hi angel and hi messeng and gabriel and michael then inde allah is an enemi to the disbeliev
  2| 99| and we have certainli reveal to you vers which are clear proof and no one would deni them except the defiantli disobedi
  2|100| is it not true that everi time they took a coven a parti of them threw it away but in fact most of them do not believ
  2|101| and when a messeng from allah came to them confirm that which wa with them a parti of those who had been given the scriptur threw the scriptur of allah behind their back as if they did not know what it contain
  2|102| and they follow instead what the devil had recit dure the reign of solomon it wa not solomon who disbeliev but the devil disbeliev teach peopl magic and that which wa reveal to the two angel at babylon harut and marut but the two angel do not teach anyon unless they say we are a trial so do not disbeliev by practic magic and yet they learn from them that by which they caus separ between a man and hi wife but they do not harm anyon through it except by permiss of allah and the peopl learn what harm them and doe not benefit them but the children of israel certainli knew that whoever purchas the magic would not have in the hereaft ani share and wretch is that for which they sold themselv if they onli knew
  2|103| and if they had believ and fear allah then the reward from allah would have been far better if they onli knew
  2|104| o you who have believ say not to allah s messeng raina but say unthurna and listen and for the disbeliev is a pain punish
  2|105| neither those who disbeliev from the peopl of the scriptur nor the polytheist wish that ani good should be sent down to you from your lord but allah select for hi merci whom he will and allah is the possessor of great bounti
  2|106| we do not abrog a vers or caus it to be forgotten except that we bring forth one better than it or similar to it do you not know that allah is over all thing compet
  2|107| do you not know that to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and that you have not besid allah ani protector or ani helper
  2|108| or do you intend to ask your messeng as mose wa ask befor and whoever exchang faith for disbelief ha certainli stray from the sound of the way
  2|109| mani of the peopl of the scriptur wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believ out of envi from themselv even after the truth ha becom clear to them so pardon and overlook until allah deliv hi command inde allah is over all thing compet
  2|110| and establish prayer and give zakah and whatev good you put forward for yourselv you will find it with allah inde allah of what you do is see
  2|111| and they say none will enter paradis except one who is a jew or a christian that is mere their wish think say produc your proof if you should be truth
  2|112| ye on the contrari whoever submit hi face in islam to allah while be a doer of good will have hi reward with hi lord and no fear will there be concern them nor will they griev
  2|113| the jew say the christian have noth true to stand on and the christian say the jew have noth to stand on although they both recit the scriptur thu the polytheist speak the same as their word but allah will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ
  2|114| and who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of allah from be mention in hi mosqu and strive toward their destruct it is not for them to enter them except in fear for them in thi world is disgrac and they will have in the hereaft a great punish
  2|115| and to allah belong the east and the west so wherev you might turn there is the face of allah inde allah is allencompass and know
  2|116| they say allah ha taken a son exalt is he rather to him belong whatev is in the heaven and the earth all are devoutli obedi to him

  2|118| those who do not know say whi doe allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign thu spoke those befor them like their word their heart resembl each other we have shown clearli the sign to a peopl who are certain in faith
  2|119| inde we have sent you o muhammad with the truth as a bringer of good tide and a warner and you will not be ask about the companion of hellfir
  2|120| and never will the jew or the christian approv of you until you follow their religion say inde the guidanc of allah is the onli guidanc if you were to follow their desir after what ha come to you of knowledg you would have against allah no protector or helper
  2|121| those to whom we have given the book recit it with it true recit they are the one who believ in it and whoever disbeliev in it it is they who are the loser
  2|122| o children of israel rememb my favor which i have bestow upon you and that i prefer you over the world

  2|131| when hi lord said to him submit he said i have submit in islam to the lord of the world
  2|132| and abraham instruct hi son to do the same and so did jacob say o my son inde allah ha chosen for you thi religion so do not die except while you are muslim
  2|133| or were you wit when death approach jacob when he said to hi son what will you worship after me they said we will worship your god and the god of your father abraham and ishmael and isaac one god and we are muslim in submiss to him

  3| 23| do you not consid o muhammad those who were given a portion of the scriptur they are invit to the scriptur of allah that it should arbitr between them then a parti of them turn away and they are refus
  3| 24| that is becaus they say never will the fire touch us except for a few number day and becaus they were delud in their religion by what they were invent
  3| 25| so how will it be when we assembl them for a day about which there is no doubt and each soul will be compens in full for what it earn and they will not be wrong

  3| 27| you caus the night to enter the day and you caus the day to enter the night and you bring the live out of the dead and you bring the dead out of the live and you give provis to whom you will without account
  3| 28| let not believ take disbeliev as alli rather than believ and whoever of you doe that ha noth with allah except when take precaut against them in prudenc and allah warn you of himself and to allah is the final destin
  3| 29| say whether you conceal what is in your breast or reveal it allah know it and he know that which is in the heaven and that which is on the earth and allah is over all thing compet
  3| 30| the day everi soul will find what it ha done of good present befor it and what it ha done of evil it will wish that between itself and that evil wa a great distanc and allah warn you of himself and allah is kind to hi servant
  3| 31| say o muhammad if you should love allah then follow me so allah will love you and forgiv you your sin and allah is forgiv and merci
  3| 32| say obey allah and the messeng but if they turn away then inde allah doe not like the disbeliev
  3| 33| inde allah chose adam and noah and the famili of abraham and the famili of imran over the world
  3| 34| descend some of them from other and allah is hear and know
  3| 35| mention o muhammad when the wife of imran said my lord inde i have pledg to you what is in my womb consecr for your servic so accept thi from me inde you are the hear the know
  3| 36| but when she deliv her she said my lord i have deliv a femal and allah wa most know of what she deliv and the male is not like the femal and i have name her mari and i seek refug for her in you and for her descend from satan the expel from the merci of allah
  3| 37| so her lord accept her with good accept and caus her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of zechariah everi time zechariah enter upon her in the prayer chamber he found with her provis he said o mari from where is thi come to you she said it is from allah inde allah provid for whom he will without account
  3| 38| at that zechariah call upon hi lord say my lord grant me from yourself a good offspr inde you are the hearer of supplic
  3| 39| so the angel call him while he wa stand in prayer in the chamber inde allah give you good tide of john confirm a word from allah and who will be honor abstain from women and a prophet from among the righteou
  3| 40| he said my lord how will i have a boy when i have reach old age and my wife is barren the angel said such is allah he doe what he will
  3| 41| he said my lord make for me a sign he said your sign is that you will not be abl to speak to the peopl for three day except by gestur and rememb your lord much and exalt him with prais in the even and the morn
  3| 42| and mention when the angel said o mari inde allah ha chosen you and purifi you and chosen you abov the women of the world
  3| 43| o mari be devoutli obedi to your lord and prostrat and bow with those who bow in prayer
  3| 44| that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad and you were not with them when they cast their pen as to which of them should be respons for mari nor were you with them when they disput
  3| 45| and mention when the angel said o mari inde allah give you good tide of a word from him whose name will be the messiah jesu the son of mari distinguish in thi world and the hereaft and among those brought near to allah
  3| 46| he will speak to the peopl in the cradl and in matur and will be of the righteou
  3| 47| she said my lord how will i have a child when no man ha touch me the angel said such is allah he creat what he will when he decre a matter he onli say to it be and it is
  3| 48| and he will teach him write and wisdom and the torah and the gospel
  3| 49| and make him a messeng to the children of israel who will say inde i have come to you with a sign from your lord in that i design for you from clay that which is like the form of a bird then i breath into it and it becom a bird by permiss of allah and i cure the blind and the leper and i give life to the dead by permiss of allah and i inform you of what you eat and what you store in your hous inde in that is a sign for you if you are believ
  3| 50| and i have come confirm what wa befor me of the torah and to make law for you some of what wa forbidden to you and i have come to you with a sign from your lord so fear allah and obey me
  3| 51| inde allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is the straight path
  3| 52| but when jesu felt persist in disbelief from them he said who are my support for the caus of allah the discipl said we are support for allah we have believ in allah and testifi that we are muslim submit to him
  3| 53| our lord we have believ in what you reveal and have follow the messeng jesu so regist us among the wit to truth
  3| 54| and the disbeliev plan but allah plan and allah is the best of planner
  3| 55| mention when allah said o jesu inde i will take you and rais you to myself and purifi you from those who disbeliev and make those who follow you in submiss to allah alon superior to those who disbeliev until the day of resurrect then to me is your return and i will judg between you concern that in which you use to differ
  3| 56| and as for those who disbeliev i will punish them with a sever punish in thi world and the hereaft and they will have no helper
  3| 57| but as for those who believ and did righteou deed he will give them in full their reward and allah doe not like the wrongdoer
  3| 58| thi is what we recit to you o muhammad of our vers and the precis and wise messag
  3| 59| inde the exampl of jesu to allah is like that of adam he creat him from dust then he said to him be and he wa
  3| 60| the truth is from your lord so do not be among the doubter
  3| 61| then whoever argu with you about it after thi knowledg ha come to you say come let us call our son and your son our women and your women ourselv and yourselv then supplic earnestli togeth and invok the curs of allah upon the liar among us
  3| 62| inde thi is the true narrat and there is no deiti except allah and inde allah is the exalt in might the wise
  3| 63| but if they turn away then inde allah is know of the corrupt
  3| 64| say o peopl of the scriptur come to a word that is equit between us and you that we will not worship except allah and not associ anyth with him and not take one anoth as lord instead of allah but if they turn away then say bear wit that we are muslim submit to him
  3| 65| o peopl of the scriptur whi do you argu about abraham while the torah and the gospel were not reveal until after him then will you not reason
  3| 66| here you are those who have argu about that of which you have some knowledg but whi do you argu about that of which you have no knowledg and allah know while you know not
  3| 67| abraham wa neither a jew nor a christian but he wa one inclin toward truth a muslim submit to allah and he wa not of the polytheist
  3| 68| inde the most worthi of abraham among the peopl are those who follow him in submiss to allah and thi prophet and those who believ in hi messag and allah is the alli of the believ
  3| 69| a faction of the peopl of the scriptur wish they could mislead you but they do not mislead except themselv and they perceiv it not
  3| 70| o peopl of the scriptur whi do you disbeliev in the vers of allah while you wit to their truth
  3| 71| o peopl of the scriptur whi do you confus the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know it
  3| 72| and a faction of the peopl of the scriptur say to each other believ in that which wa reveal to the believ at the begin of the day and reject it at it end that perhap they will abandon their religion
  3| 73| and do not trust except those who follow your religion say inde the true guidanc is the guidanc of allah do you fear lest someon be given knowledg like you were given or that they would therebi argu with you befor your lord say inde all bounti is in the hand of allah he grant it to whom he will and allah is allencompass and wise
  3| 74| he select for hi merci whom he will and allah is the possessor of great bounti
  3| 75| and among the peopl of the scriptur is he who if you entrust him with a great amount of wealth he will return it to you and among them is he who if you entrust him with a singl silver coin he will not return it to you unless you are constantli stand over him demand it that is becaus they say there is no blame upon us concern the unlearn and they speak untruth about allah while they know it
  3| 76| but ye whoever fulfil hi commit and fear allah then inde allah love those who fear him
  3| 77| inde those who exchang the coven of allah and their own oath for a small price will have no share in the hereaft and allah will not speak to them or look at them on the day of resurrect nor will he purifi them and they will have a pain punish
  3| 78| and inde there is among them a parti who alter the scriptur with their tongu so you may think it is from the scriptur but it is not from the scriptur and they say thi is from allah but it is not from allah and they speak untruth about allah while they know
  3| 79| it is not for a human prophet that allah should give him the scriptur and author and prophethood and then he would say to the peopl be servant to me rather than allah but instead he would say be piou scholar of the lord becaus of what you have taught of the scriptur and becaus of what you have studi
  3| 80| nor could he order you to take the angel and prophet as lord would he order you to disbelief after you had been muslim
  3| 81| and recal o peopl of the scriptur when allah took the coven of the prophet say whatev i give you of the scriptur and wisdom and then there come to you a messeng confirm what is with you you must believ in him and support him allah said have you acknowledg and taken upon that my commit they said we have acknowledg it he said then bear wit and i am with you among the wit
  3| 82| and whoever turn away after that they were the defiantli disobedi
  3| 83| so is it other than the religion of allah they desir while to him have submit all those within the heaven and earth willingli or by compuls and to him they will be return
  3| 84| say we have believ in allah and in what wa reveal to us and what wa reveal to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the descend and in what wa given to mose and jesu and to the prophet from their lord we make no distinct between ani of them and we are muslim submit to him
  3| 85| and whoever desir other than islam as religion never will it be accept from him and he in the hereaft will be among the loser
  3| 86| how shall allah guid a peopl who disbeliev after their belief and had wit that the messeng is true and clear sign had come to them and allah doe not guid the wrongdo peopl
  3| 87| those their recompens will be that upon them is the curs of allah and the angel and the peopl all togeth
  3| 88| abid etern therein the punish will not be lighten for them nor will they be repriev
  3| 89| except for those who repent after that and correct themselv for inde allah is forgiv and merci
  3| 90| inde those who reject the messag after their belief and then increas in disbelief never will their claim repent be accept and they are the one astray
  3| 91| inde those who disbeliev and die while they are disbeliev never would the whole capac of the earth in gold be accept from one of them if he would seek to ransom himself with it for those there will be a pain punish and they will have no helper
  3| 92| never will you attain the good reward until you spend in the way of allah from that which you love and whatev you spend inde allah is know of it
  3| 93| all food wa law to the children of israel except what israel had made unlaw to himself befor the torah wa reveal say o muhammad so bring the torah and recit it if you should be truth
  3| 94| and whoever invent about allah untruth after that then those are truli the wrongdoer
  3| 95| say allah ha told the truth so follow the religion of abraham inclin toward truth and he wa not of the polytheist
  3| 96| inde the first hous of worship establish for mankind wa that at makkah bless and a guidanc for the world
  3| 97| in it are clear sign such as the stand place of abraham and whoever enter it shall be safe and due to allah from the peopl is a pilgrimag to the hous for whoever is abl to find thereto a way but whoever disbeliev then inde allah is free from need of the world
  3| 98| say o peopl of the scriptur whi do you disbeliev in the vers of allah while allah is wit over what you do
  3| 99| say o peopl of the scriptur whi do you avert from the way of allah those who believ seek to make it seem deviant while you are wit to the truth and allah is not unawar of what you do
  3|100| o you who have believ if you obey a parti of those who were given the scriptur they would turn you back after your belief to be unbeliev
  3|101| and how could you disbeliev while to you are be recit the vers of allah and among you is hi messeng and whoever hold firmli to allah ha inde been guid to a straight path
  3|102| o you who have believ fear allah as he should be fear and do not die except as muslim in submiss to him
  3|103| and hold firmli to the rope of allah all togeth and do not becom divid and rememb the favor of allah upon you when you were enemi and he brought your heart togeth and you becam by hi favor brother and you were on the edg of a pit of the fire and he save you from it thu doe allah make clear to you hi vers that you may be guid
  3|104| and let there be aris from you a nation invit to all that is good enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and those will be the success
  3|105| and do not be like the one who becam divid and differ after the clear proof had come to them and those will have a great punish
  3|106| on the day some face will turn white and some face will turn black as for those whose face turn black to them it will be said did you disbeliev after your belief then tast the punish for what you use to reject
  3|107| but as for those whose face will turn white they will be within the merci of allah they will abid therein etern
  3|108| these are the vers of allah we recit them to you o muhammad in truth and allah want no injustic to the world
  3|109| to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth and to allah will all matter be return
  3|110| you are the best nation produc as an exampl for mankind you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believ in allah if onli the peopl of the scriptur had believ it would have been better for them among them are believ but most of them are defiantli disobedi
  3|111| they will not harm you except for some annoy and if they fight you they will show you their back then they will not be aid
  3|112| they have been put under humili by allah wherev they are overtaken except for a coven from allah and a rope from the muslim and they have drawn upon themselv anger from allah and have been put under destitut that is becaus they disbeliev in the vers of allah and kill the prophet without right that is becaus they disobey and habitu transgress
  3|113| they are not all the same among the peopl of the scriptur is a commun stand in obedi recit the vers of allah dure period of the night and prostrat in prayer
  3|114| they believ in allah and the last day and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deed and those are among the righteou
  3|115| and whatev good they do never will it be remov from them and allah is know of the righteou
  3|116| inde those who disbeliev never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all and those are the companion of the fire they will abid therein etern
  3|117| the exampl of what they spend in thi worldli life is like that of a wind contain frost which strike the harvest of a peopl who have wrong themselv and destroy it and allah ha not wrong them but they wrong themselv
  3|118| o you who have believ do not take as intim those other than yourselv for they will not spare you ani ruin they wish you would have hardship hatr ha alreadi appear from their mouth and what their breast conceal is greater we have certainli made clear to you the sign if you will use reason
  3|119| here you are love them but they are not love you while you believ in the scriptur all of it and when they meet you they say we believ but when they are alon they bite their fingertip at you in rage say die in your rage inde allah is know of that within the breast
  3|120| if good touch you it distress them but if harm strike you they rejoic at it and if you are patient and fear allah their plot will not harm you at all inde allah is encompass of what they do
  3|121| and rememb when you o muhammad left your famili in the morn to post the believ at their station for the battl of uhud and allah is hear and know
  3|122| when two parti among you were about to lose courag but allah wa their alli and upon allah the believ should reli
  3|123| and alreadi had allah given you victori at the battl of badr while you were few in number then fear allah perhap you will be grate
  3|124| rememb when you said to the believ is it not suffici for you that your lord should reinforc you with three thousand angel sent down
  3|125| ye if you remain patient and consciou of allah and the enemi come upon you attack in rage your lord will reinforc you with five thousand angel have mark of distinct
  3|126| and allah made it not except as a sign of good tide for you and to reassur your heart therebi and victori is not except from allah the exalt in might the wise
  3|127| that he might cut down a section of the disbeliev or suppress them so that they turn back disappoint
  3|128| not for you o muhammad but for allah is the decis whether he should cut them down or forgiv them or punish them for inde they are wrongdoer
  3|129| and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth he forgiv whom he will and punish whom he will and allah is forgiv and merci
  3|130| o you who have believ do not consum usuri doubl and multipli but fear allah that you may be success
  3|131| and fear the fire which ha been prepar for the disbeliev
  3|132| and obey allah and the messeng that you may obtain merci
  3|133| and hasten to forgiv from your lord and a garden as wide as the heaven and earth prepar for the righteou
  3|134| who spend in the caus of allah dure eas and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the peopl and allah love the doer of good
  3|135| and those who when they commit an immor or wrong themselv by transgress rememb allah and seek forgiv for their sin and who can forgiv sin except allah and who do not persist in what they have done while they know
  3|136| those their reward is forgiv from their lord and garden beneath which river flow in paradis wherein they will abid etern and excel is the reward of the righteou worker
  3|137| similar situat as your have pass on befor you so proceed throughout the earth and observ how wa the end of those who deni
  3|138| thi quran is a clear statement to all the peopl and a guidanc and instruct for those consciou of allah
  3|139| so do not weaken and do not griev and you will be superior if you are true believ
  3|140| if a wound should touch you there ha alreadi touch the oppos peopl a wound similar to it and these day of vari condit we altern among the peopl so that allah may make evid those who believ and may take to himself from among you martyr and allah doe not like the wrongdoer
  3|141| and that allah may purifi the believ through trial and destroy the disbeliev
  3|142| or do you think that you will enter paradis while allah ha not yet made evid those of you who fight in hi caus and made evid those who are steadfast
  3|143| and you had certainli wish for martyrdom befor you encount it and you have now seen it befor you while you were look on
  3|144| muhammad is not but a messeng other messeng have pass on befor him so if he wa to die or be kill would you turn back on your heel to unbelief and he who turn back on hi heel will never harm allah at all but allah will reward the grate
  3|145| and it is not possibl for one to die except by permiss of allah at a decre determin and whoever desir the reward of thi world we will give him thereof and whoever desir the reward of the hereaft we will give him thereof and we will reward the grate
  3|146| and how mani a prophet fought and with him fought mani religi scholar but they never lost assur due to what afflict them in the caus of allah nor did they weaken or submit and allah love the steadfast
  3|147| and their word were not but that they said our lord forgiv us our sin and the excess commit in our affair and plant firmli our feet and give us victori over the disbeliev peopl
  3|148| so allah gave them the reward of thi world and the good reward of the hereaft and allah love the doer of good
  3|149| o you who have believ if you obey those who disbeliev they will turn you back on your heel and you will then becom loser
  3|150| but allah is your protector and he is the best of helper
  3|151| we will cast terror into the heart of those who disbeliev for what they have associ with allah of which he had not sent down ani author and their refug will be the fire and wretch is the resid of the wrongdoer
  3|152| and allah had certainli fulfil hi promis to you when you were kill the enemi by hi permiss until the time when you lost courag and fell to disput about the order given by the prophet and disobey after he had shown you that which you love among you are some who desir thi world and among you are some who desir the hereaft then he turn you back from them defeat that he might test you and he ha alreadi forgiven you and allah is the possessor of bounti for the believ
  3|153| rememb when you fled and climb the mountain without look asid at anyon while the messeng wa call you from behind so allah repaid you with distress upon distress so you would not griev for that which had escap you of victori and spoil of war or for that which had befallen you of injuri and death and allah is fulli acquaint with what you do
  3|154| then after distress he sent down upon you secur in the form of drowsi overcom a faction of you while anoth faction worri about themselv think of allah other than the truth the thought of ignor say is there anyth for us to have done in thi matter say inde the matter belong complet to allah they conceal within themselv what they will not reveal to you they say if there wa anyth we could have done in the matter some of us would not have been kill right here say even if you had been insid your hous those decre to be kill would have come out to their death bed it wa so that allah might test what is in your breast and purifi what is in your heart and allah is know of that within the breast
  3|155| inde those of you who turn back on the day the two armi met it wa satan who caus them to slip becaus of some blame they had earn but allah ha alreadi forgiven them inde allah is forgiv and forbear
  3|156| o you who have believ do not be like those who disbeliev and said about their brother when they travel through the land or went out to fight if they had been with us they would not have die or have been kill so allah make that misconcept a regret within their heart and it is allah who give life and caus death and allah is see of what you do
  3|157| and if you are kill in the caus of allah or die then forgiv from allah and merci are better than whatev they accumul in thi world
  3|158| and whether you die or are kill unto allah you will be gather
  3|159| so by merci from allah o muhammad you were lenient with them and if you had been rude in speech and harsh in heart they would have disband from about you so pardon them and ask forgiv for them and consult them in the matter and when you have decid then reli upon allah inde allah love those who reli upon him
  3|160| if allah should aid you no one can overcom you but if he should forsak you who is there that can aid you after him and upon allah let the believ reli
  3|161| it is not attribut to ani prophet that he would act unfaith in regard to war booti and whoever betray take unlaw will come with what he took on the day of resurrect then will everi soul be fulli compens for what it earn and they will not be wrong
  3|162| so is one who pursu the pleasur of allah like one who bring upon himself the anger of allah and whose refug is hell and wretch is the destin
  3|163| they are vari degre in the sight of allah and allah is see of whatev they do
  3|164| certainli did allah confer great favor upon the believ when he sent among them a messeng from themselv recit to them hi vers and purifi them and teach them the book and wisdom although they had been befor in manifest error
  3|165| whi is it that when a singl disast struck you on the day of uhud although you had struck the enemi in the battl of badr with one twice as great you said from where is thi say it is from yourselv inde allah is over all thing compet
  3|166| and what struck you on the day the two armi met wa by permiss of allah that he might make evid the true believ
  3|167| and that he might make evid those who are hypocrit for it wa said to them come fight in the way of allah or at least defend they said if we had known there would be fight we would have follow you they were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith say with their mouth what wa not in their heart and allah is most know of what they conceal
  3|168| those who said about their brother while sit at home if they had obey us they would not have been kill say then prevent death from yourselv if you should be truth
  3|169| and never think of those who have been kill in the caus of allah as dead rather they are aliv with their lord receiv provis
  3|170| rejoic in what allah ha bestow upon them of hi bounti and they receiv good tide about those to be martyr after them who have not yet join them that there will be no fear concern them nor will they griev
  3|171| they receiv good tide of favor from allah and bounti and of the fact that allah doe not allow the reward of believ to be lost
  3|172| those believ who respond to allah and the messeng after injuri had struck them for those who did good among them and fear allah is a great reward
  3|173| those to whom hypocrit said inde the peopl have gather against you so fear them but it mere increas them in faith and they said suffici for us is allah and he is the best dispos of affair
  3|174| so they return with favor from allah and bounti no harm have touch them and they pursu the pleasur of allah and allah is the possessor of great bounti
  3|175| that is onli satan who frighten you of hi support so fear them not but fear me if you are inde believ
  3|176| and do not be griev o muhammad by those who hasten into disbelief inde they will never harm allah at all allah intend that he should give them no share in the hereaft and for them is a great punish
  3|177| inde those who purchas disbelief in exchang for faith never will they harm allah at all and for them is a pain punish
  3|178| and let not those who disbeliev ever think that becaus we extend their time of enjoy it is better for them we onli extend it for them so that they may increas in sin and for them is a humili punish
  3|179| allah would not leav the believ in that state you are in present until he separ the evil from the good nor would allah reveal to you the unseen but instead allah choos of hi messeng whom he will so believ in allah and hi messeng and if you believ and fear him then for you is a great reward
  3|180| and let not those who greedili withhold what allah ha given them of hi bounti ever think that it is better for them rather it is wors for them their neck will be encircl by what they withheld on the day of resurrect and to allah belong the heritag of the heaven and the earth and allah with what you do is fulli acquaint
  3|181| allah ha certainli heard the statement of those jew who said inde allah is poor while we are rich we will record what they said and their kill of the prophet without right and will say tast the punish of the burn fire
  3|182| that is for what your hand have put forth and becaus allah is not ever unjust to hi servant
  3|183| they are those who said inde allah ha taken our promis not to believ ani messeng until he bring us an offer which fire from heaven will consum say there have alreadi come to you messeng befor me with clear proof and even that of which you speak so whi did you kill them if you should be truth
  3|184| then if they deni you o muhammad so were messeng deni befor you who brought clear proof and written ordin and the enlighten scriptur
  3|185| everi soul will tast death and you will onli be given your full compens on the day of resurrect so he who is drawn away from the fire and admit to paradis ha attain hi desir and what is the life of thi world except the enjoy of delus
  3|186| you will sure be test in your possess and in yourselv and you will sure hear from those who were given the scriptur befor you and from those who associ other with allah much abus but if you are patient and fear allah inde that is of the matter worthi of determin
  3|187| and mention o muhammad when allah took a coven from those who were given the scriptur say you must make it clear to the peopl and not conceal it but they threw it away behind their back and exchang it for a small price and wretch is that which they purchas
  3|188| and never think that those who rejoic in what they have perpetr and like to be prais for what they did not do never think them to be in safeti from the punish and for them is a pain punish
  3|189| and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and allah is over all thing compet
  3|190| inde in the creation of the heaven and the earth and the altern of the night and the day are sign for those of understand
  3|191| who rememb allah while stand or sit or lie on their side and give thought to the creation of the heaven and the earth say our lord you did not creat thi aimlessli exalt are you abov such a thing then protect us from the punish of the fire
  3|192| our lord inde whoever you admit to the fire you have disgrac him and for the wrongdoer there are no helper
  3|193| our lord inde we have heard a caller call to faith say believ in your lord and we have believ our lord so forgiv us our sin and remov from us our misde and caus us to die with the righteou
  3|194| our lord and grant us what you promis us through your messeng and do not disgrac us on the day of resurrect inde you do not fail in your promis
  3|195| and their lord respond to them never will i allow to be lost the work of ani worker among you whether male or femal you are of one anoth so those who emigr or were evict from their home or were harm in my caus or fought or were kill i will sure remov from them their misde and i will sure admit them to garden beneath which river flow as reward from allah and allah ha with him the best reward
  3|196| be not deceiv by the uninhibit movement of the disbeliev throughout the land
  3|197| it is but a small enjoy then their final refug is hell and wretch is the rest place
  3|198| but those who fear their lord will have garden beneath which river flow abid etern therein as accommod from allah and that which is with allah is best for the righteou
  3|199| and inde among the peopl of the scriptur are those who believ in allah and what wa reveal to you and what wa reveal to them be humbl submiss to allah they do not exchang the vers of allah for a small price those will have their reward with their lord inde allah is swift in account
  3|200| o you who have believ persever and endur and remain station and fear allah that you may be success
  4|  1| o mankind fear your lord who creat you from one soul and creat from it it mate and dispers from both of them mani men and women and fear allah through whom you ask one anoth and the womb inde allah is ever over you an observ
  4|  2| and give to the orphan their properti and do not substitut the defect of your own for the good of their and do not consum their properti into your own inde that is ever a great sin
  4|  3| and if you fear that you will not deal justli with the orphan girl then marri those that pleas you of other women two or three or four but if you fear that you will not be just then marri onli one or those your right hand possess that is more suitabl that you may not inclin to injustic
  4|  4| and give the women upon marriag their bridal gift gracious but if they give up willingli to you anyth of it then take it in satisfact and eas
  4|  5| and do not give the weakmind your properti which allah ha made a mean of susten for you but provid for them with it and cloth them and speak to them word of appropri kind
  4|  6| and test the orphan in their abil until they reach marriag age then if you perceiv in them sound judgement releas their properti to them and do not consum it excess and quickli anticip that they will grow up and whoever when act as guardian is selfsuffici should refrain from take a fee and whoever is poor let him take accord to what is accept then when you releas their properti to them bring wit upon them and suffici is allah as account
  4|  7| for men is a share of what the parent and close rel leav and for women is a share of what the parent and close rel leav be it littl or much an obligatori share
  4|  8| and when other rel and orphan and the needi are present at the time of divis then provid for them someth out of the estat and speak to them word of appropri kind
  4|  9| and let those executor and guardian fear injustic as if they themselv had left weak offspr behind and fear for them so let them fear allah and speak word of appropri justic
  4| 10| inde those who devour the properti of orphan unjustli are onli consum into their belli fire and they will be burn in a blaze
  4| 11| allah instruct you concern your children for the male what is equal to the share of two femal but if there are onli daughter two or more for them is two third of one estat and if there is onli one for her is half and for one parent to each one of them is a sixth of hi estat if he left children but if he had no children and the parent alon inherit from him then for hi mother is one third and if he had brother or sister for hi mother is a sixth after ani bequest he may have made or debt your parent or your children you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit these share are an oblig impos by allah inde allah is ever know and wise
  4| 12| and for you is half of what your wive leav if they have no child but if they have a child for you is one fourth of what they leav after ani bequest they may have made or debt and for the wive is one fourth if you leav no child but if you leav a child then for them is an eighth of what you leav after ani bequest you may have made or debt and if a man or woman leav neither ascend nor descend but ha a brother or a sister then for each one of them is a sixth but if they are more than two they share a third after ani bequest which wa made or debt as long as there is no detriment caus thi is an ordin from allah and allah is know and forbear
  4| 13| these are the limit set by allah and whoever obey allah and hi messeng will be admit by him to garden in paradis under which river flow abid etern therein and that is the great attain
  4| 14| and whoever disobey allah and hi messeng and transgress hi limit he will put him into the fire to abid etern therein and he will have a humili punish
  4| 15| those who commit unlaw sexual intercours of your women bring against them four wit from among you and if they testifi confin the guilti women to hous until death take them or allah ordain for them anoth way
  4| 16| and the two who commit it among you dishonor them both but if they repent and correct themselv leav them alon inde allah is ever accept of repent and merci
  4| 17| the repent accept by allah is onli for those who do wrong in ignor or careless and then repent soon after it is those to whom allah will turn in forgiv and allah is ever know and wise
  4| 18| but repent is not accept of those who continu to do evil deed up until when death come to one of them he say inde i have repent now or of those who die while they are disbeliev for them we have prepar a pain punish
  4| 19| o you who have believ it is not law for you to inherit women by compuls and do not make difficulti for them in order to take back part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immor and live with them in kind for if you dislik them perhap you dislik a thing and allah make therein much good
  4| 20| but if you want to replac one wife with anoth and you have given one of them a great amount in gift do not take back from it anyth would you take it in injustic and manifest sin
  4| 21| and how could you take it while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a solemn coven
  4| 22| and do not marri those women whom your father marri except what ha alreadi occur inde it wa an immor and hate to allah and wa evil as a way
  4| 23| prohibit to you for marriag are your mother your daughter your sister your father sister your mother sister your brother daughter your sister daughter your milk mother who nurs you your sister through nurs your wive mother and your stepdaught under your guardianship born of your wive unto whom you have gone in but if you have not gone in unto them there is no sin upon you and also prohibit are the wive of your son who are from your own loin and that you take in marriag two sister simultan except for what ha alreadi occur inde allah is ever forgiv and merci
  4| 24| and also prohibit to you are all marri women except those your right hand possess thi is the decre of allah upon you and law to you are all other beyond these provid that you seek them in marriag with gift from your properti desir chastiti not unlaw sexual intercours so for whatev you enjoy of marriag from them give them their due compens as an oblig and there is no blame upon you for what you mutual agre to beyond the oblig inde allah is ever know and wise
  4| 25| and whoever among you can not find the mean to marri free believ women then he may marri from those whom your right hand possess of believ slave girl and allah is most know about your faith you believ are of one anoth so marri them with the permiss of their peopl and give them their due compens accord to what is accept they should be chast neither of those who commit unlaw intercours randomli nor those who take secret lover but onc they are shelter in marriag if they should commit adulteri then for them is half the punish for free unmarri women thi allow is for him among you who fear sin but to be patient is better for you and allah is forgiv and merci
  4| 26| allah want to make clear to you the law from the unlaw and guid you to the good practic of those befor you and to accept your repent and allah is know and wise
  4| 27| allah want to accept your repent but those who follow their passion want you to digress into a great deviat
  4| 28| and allah want to lighten for you your difficulti and mankind wa creat weak
  4| 29| o you who have believ do not consum one anoth wealth unjustli but onli in law busi by mutual consent and do not kill yourselv or one anoth inde allah is to you ever merci
  4| 30| and whoever doe that in aggress and injustic then we will drive him into a fire and that for allah is alway easi
  4| 31| if you avoid the major sin which you are forbidden we will remov from you your lesser sin and admit you to a nobl entranc into paradis
  4| 32| and do not wish for that by which allah ha made some of you exceed other for men is a share of what they have earn and for women is a share of what they have earn and ask allah of hi bounti inde allah is ever of all thing know
  4| 33| and for all we have made heir to what is left by parent and rel and to those whom your oath have bound to you give them their share inde allah is ever over all thing a wit
  4| 34| men are in charg of women by right of what allah ha given one over the other and what they spend for mainten from their wealth so righteou women are devoutli obedi guard in the husband absenc what allah would have them guard but those wive from whom you fear arrog first advis them then if they persist forsak them in bed and final strike them but if they obey you onc more seek no mean against them inde allah is ever exalt and grand
  4| 35| and if you fear dissens between the two send an arbitr from hi peopl and an arbitr from her peopl if they both desir reconcili allah will caus it between them inde allah is ever know and acquaint with all thing
  4| 36| worship allah and associ noth with him and to parent do good and to rel orphan the needi the near neighbor the neighbor farther away the companion at your side the travel and those whom your right hand possess inde allah doe not like those who are selfdelud and boast
  4| 37| who are stingi and enjoin upon other peopl stingi and conceal what allah ha given them of hi bounti and we have prepar for the disbeliev a humili punish
  4| 38| and also those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the peopl and believ not in allah nor in the last day and he to whom satan is a companion then evil is he as a companion
  4| 39| and what harm would come upon them if they believ in allah and the last day and spent out of what allah provid for them and allah is ever about them know
  4| 40| inde allah doe not do injustic even as much as an atom weight while if there is a good deed he multipli it and give from himself a great reward
  4| 41| so how will it be when we bring from everi nation a wit and we bring you o muhammad against these peopl as a wit
  4| 42| that day those who disbeliev and disobey the messeng will wish they could be cover by the earth and they will not conceal from allah a singl statement
  4| 43| o you who have believ do not approach prayer while you are intox until you know what you are say or in a state of janabah except those pass through a place of prayer until you have wash your whole bodi and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you come from the place of reliev himself or you have contact women and find no water then seek clean earth and wipe over your face and your hand with it inde allah is ever pardon and forgiv
  4| 44| have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scriptur purchas error in exchang for it and wish you would lose the way
  4| 45| and allah is most know of your enemi and suffici is allah as an alli and suffici is allah as a helper
  4| 46| among the jew are those who distort word from their proper usag and say we hear and disobey and hear but be not heard and raina twist their tongu and defam the religion and if they had said instead we hear and obey and wait for us to understand it would have been better for them and more suitabl but allah ha curs them for their disbelief so they believ not except for a few
  4| 47| o you who were given the scriptur believ in what we have sent down to muhammad confirm that which is with you befor we obliter face and turn them toward their back or curs them as we curs the sabbathbreak and ever is the decre of allah accomplish
  4| 48| inde allah doe not forgiv associ with him but he forgiv what is less than that for whom he will and he who associ other with allah ha certainli fabric a tremend sin
  4| 49| have you not seen those who claim themselv to be pure rather allah purifi whom he will and injustic is not done to them even as much as a thread insid a date seed
  4| 50| look how they invent about allah untruth and suffici is that as a manifest sin
  4| 51| have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scriptur who believ in superstit and fals object of worship and say about the disbeliev these are better guid than the believ as to the way
  4| 52| those are the one whom allah ha curs and he whom allah curs never will you find for him a helper
  4| 53| or have they a share of dominion then if that were so they would not give the peopl even as much as the speck on a date seed
  4| 54| or do they envi peopl for what allah ha given them of hi bounti but we had alreadi given the famili of abraham the scriptur and wisdom and confer upon them a great kingdom
  4| 55| and some among them believ in it and some among them were avers to it and suffici is hell as a blaze
  4| 56| inde those who disbeliev in our vers we will drive them into a fire everi time their skin are roast through we will replac them with other skin so they may tast the punish inde allah is ever exalt in might and wise
  4| 57| but those who believ and do righteou deed we will admit them to garden beneath which river flow wherein they abid forev for them therein are purifi spous and we will admit them to deepen shade
  4| 58| inde allah command you to render trust to whom they are due and when you judg between peopl to judg with justic excel is that which allah instruct you inde allah is ever hear and see
  4| 59| o you who have believ obey allah and obey the messeng and those in author among you and if you disagre over anyth refer it to allah and the messeng if you should believ in allah and the last day that is the best way and best in result
  4| 60| have you not seen those who claim to have believ in what wa reveal to you o muhammad and what wa reveal befor you they wish to refer legisl to taghut while they were command to reject it and satan wish to lead them far astray
  4| 61| and when it is said to them come to what allah ha reveal and to the messeng you see the hypocrit turn away from you in avers
  4| 62| so how will it be when disast strike them becaus of what their hand have put forth and then they come to you swear by allah we intend noth but good conduct and accommod
  4| 63| those are the one of whom allah know what is in their heart so turn away from them but admonish them and speak to them a farreach word
  4| 64| and we did not send ani messeng except to be obey by permiss of allah and if when they wrong themselv they had come to you o muhammad and ask forgiv of allah and the messeng had ask forgiv for them they would have found allah accept of repent and merci
  4| 65| but no by your lord they will not truli believ until they make you o muhammad judg concern that over which they disput among themselv and then find within themselv no discomfort from what you have judg and submit in full will submiss
  4| 66| and if we had decre upon them kill yourselv or leav your home they would not have done it except for a few of them but if they had done what they were instruct it would have been better for them and a firmer posit for them in faith
  4| 67| and then we would have given them from us a great reward
  4| 68| and we would have guid them to a straight path
  4| 69| and whoever obey allah and the messeng those will be with the one upon whom allah ha bestow favor of the prophet the steadfast affirm of truth the martyr and the righteou and excel are those as companion
  4| 70| that is the bounti from allah and suffici is allah as knower
  4| 71| o you who have believ take your precaut and either go forth in compani or go forth all togeth
  4| 72| and inde there is among you he who linger behind and if disast strike you he say allah ha favor me in that i wa not present with them
  4| 73| but if bounti come to you from allah he will sure say as if there had never been between you and him ani affect oh i wish i had been with them so i could have attain a great attain
  4| 74| so let those fight in the caus of allah who sell the life of thi world for the hereaft and he who fight in the caus of allah and is kill or achiev victori we will bestow upon him a great reward
  4| 75| and what is the matter with you that you fight not in the caus of allah and for the oppress among men women and children who say our lord take us out of thi citi of oppress peopl and appoint for us from yourself a protector and appoint for us from yourself a helper
  4| 76| those who believ fight in the caus of allah and those who disbeliev fight in the caus of taghut so fight against the alli of satan inde the plot of satan ha ever been weak
  4| 77| have you not seen those who were told restrain your hand from fight and establish prayer and give zakah but then when fight wa ordain for them at onc a parti of them fear men as they fear allah or with even greater fear they said our lord whi have you decre upon us fight if onli you had postpon it for us for a short time say the enjoy of thi world is littl and the hereaft is better for he who fear allah and injustic will not be done to you even as much as a thread insid a date seed
  4| 78| wherev you may be death will overtak you even if you should be within tower of lofti construct but if good come to them they say thi is from allah and if evil befal them they say thi is from you say all thing are from allah so what is the matter with those peopl that they can hardli understand ani statement
  4| 79| what come to you of good is from allah but what come to you of evil o man is from yourself and we have sent you o muhammad to the peopl as a messeng and suffici is allah as wit
  4| 80| he who obey the messeng ha obey allah but those who turn away we have not sent you over them as a guardian
  4| 81| and they say we pledg obedi but when they leav you a group of them spend the night determin to do other than what you say but allah record what they plan by night so leav them alon and reli upon allah and suffici is allah as dispos of affair
  4| 82| then do they not reflect upon the quran if it had been from ani other than allah they would have found within it much contradict
  4| 83| and when there come to them inform about public secur or fear they spread it around but if they had refer it back to the messeng or to those of author among them then the one who can draw correct conclus from it would have known about it and if not for the favor of allah upon you and hi merci you would have follow satan except for a few
  4| 84| so fight o muhammad in the caus of allah you are not held respons except for yourself and encourag the believ to join you that perhap allah will restrain the militari might of those who disbeliev and allah is greater in might and stronger in exemplari punish
  4| 85| whoever interced for a good caus will have a reward therefrom and whoever interced for an evil caus will have a burden therefrom and ever is allah over all thing a keeper
  4| 86| and when you are greet with a greet greet in return with one better than it or at least return it in a like manner inde allah is ever over all thing an account
  4| 87| allah there is no deiti except him he will sure assembl you for account on the day of resurrect about which there is no doubt and who is more truth than allah in statement
  4| 88| what is the matter with you that you are two group concern the hypocrit while allah ha made them fall back into error and disbelief for what they earn do you wish to guid those whom allah ha sent astray and he whom allah send astray never will you find for him a way of guidanc
  4| 89| they wish you would disbeliev as they disbeliev so you would be alik so do not take from among them alli until they emigr for the caus of allah but if they turn away then seiz them and kill them wherev you find them and take not from among them ani alli or helper
  4| 90| except for those who take refug with a peopl between yourselv and whom is a treati or those who come to you their heart strain at the prospect of fight you or fight their own peopl and if allah had will he could have given them power over you and they would have fought you so if they remov themselv from you and do not fight you and offer you peac then allah ha not made for you a caus for fight against them
  4| 91| you will find other who wish to obtain secur from you and to obtain secur from their peopl everi time they are return to the influenc of disbelief they fall back into it so if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peac or restrain their hand then seiz them and kill them wherev you overtak them and those we have made for you against them a clear author
  4| 92| and never is it for a believ to kill a believ except by mistak and whoever kill a believ by mistak then the free of a believ slave and a compens payment present to the deceas famili is requir unless they give up their right as chariti but if the deceas wa from a peopl at war with you and he wa a believ then onli the free of a believ slave and if he wa from a peopl with whom you have a treati then a compens payment present to hi famili and the free of a believ slave and whoever doe not find one or can not afford to buy one then instead a fast for two month consecut seek accept of repent from allah and allah is ever know and wise

  5| 14| and from those who say we are christian we took their coven but they forgot a portion of that of which they were remind so we caus among them animos and hatr until the day of resurrect and allah is go to inform them about what they use to do
  5| 15| o peopl of the scriptur there ha come to you our messeng make clear to you much of what you use to conceal of the scriptur and overlook much there ha come to you from allah a light and a clear book
  5| 16| by which allah guid those who pursu hi pleasur to the way of peac and bring them out from dark into the light by hi permiss and guid them to a straight path

  5| 20| and mention o muhammad when mose said to hi peopl o my peopl rememb the favor of allah upon you when he appoint among you prophet and made you possessor and gave you that which he had not given anyon among the world
  5| 21| o my peopl enter the holi land which allah ha assign to you and do not turn back from fight in allah s caus and thu becom loser
  5| 22| they said o mose inde within it is a peopl of tyrann strength and inde we will never enter it until they leav it but if they leav it then we will enter
  5| 23| said two men from those who fear to disobey upon whom allah had bestow favor enter upon them through the gate for when you have enter it you will be predomin and upon allah reli if you should be believ
  5| 24| they said o mose inde we will not enter it ever as long as they are within it so go you and your lord and fight inde we are remain right here
  5| 25| mose said my lord inde i do not possess except myself and my brother so part us from the defiantli disobedi peopl
  5| 26| allah said then inde it is forbidden to them for forti year in which they will wander throughout the land so do not griev over the defiantli disobedi peopl
  5| 27| and recit to them the stori of adam two son in truth when they both offer a sacrific to allah and it wa accept from one of them but wa not accept from the other said the latter i will sure kill you said the former inde allah onli accept from the righteou who fear him
  5| 28| if you should rais your hand against me to kill me i shall not rais my hand against you to kill you inde i fear allah lord of the world

  5| 30| and hi soul permit to him the murder of hi brother so he kill him and becam among the loser
  5| 31| then allah sent a crow search in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrac of hi brother he said o woe to me have i fail to be like thi crow and hide the bodi of my brother and he becam of the regret
  5| 32| becaus of that we decre upon the children of israel that whoever kill a soul unless for a soul or for corrupt done in the land it is as if he had slain mankind entir and whoever save one it is as if he had save mankind entir and our messeng had certainli come to them with clear proof then inde mani of them even after that throughout the land were transgressor
  5| 33| inde the penalti for those who wage war against allah and hi messeng and strive upon earth to caus corrupt is none but that they be kill or crucifi or that their hand and feet be cut off from opposit side or that they be exil from the land that is for them a disgrac in thi world and for them in the hereaft is a great punish
  5| 34| except for those who return repent befor you apprehend them and know that allah is forgiv and merci

  5| 36| inde those who disbeliev if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselv from the punish of the day of resurrect it will not be accept from them and for them is a pain punish
  5| 37| they will wish to get out of the fire but never are they to emerg therefrom and for them is an endur punish
  5| 38| as for the thief the male and the femal amput their hand in recompens for what they commit as a deterr punish from allah and allah is exalt in might and wise
  5| 39| but whoever repent after hi wrongdo and reform inde allah will turn to him in forgiv inde allah is forgiv and merci
  5| 40| do you not know that to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth he punish whom he will and forgiv whom he will and allah is over all thing compet
  5| 41| o messeng let them not griev you who hasten into disbelief of those who say we believ with their mouth but their heart believ not and from among the jew they are avid listen to falsehood listen to anoth peopl who have not come to you they distort word beyond their proper usag say if you are given thi take it but if you are not given it then bewar but he for whom allah intend fitnah never will you possess power to do for him a thing against allah those are the one for whom allah doe not intend to purifi their heart for them in thi world is disgrac and for them in the hereaft is a great punish
  5| 42| they are avid listen to falsehood devour of what is unlaw so if they come to you o muhammad judg between them or turn away from them and if you turn away from them never will they harm you at all and if you judg judg between them with justic inde allah love those who act justli
  5| 43| but how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the torah in which is the judgement of allah then they turn away even after that but those are not in fact believ
  5| 44| inde we sent down the torah in which wa guidanc and light the prophet who submit to allah judg by it for the jew as did the rabbi and scholar by that with which they were entrust of the scriptur of allah and they were wit thereto so do not fear the peopl but fear me and do not exchang my vers for a small price and whoever doe not judg by what allah ha reveal then it is those who are the disbeliev
  5| 45| and we ordain for them therein a life for a life an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and for wound is legal retribut but whoever give up hi right as chariti it is an expiat for him and whoever doe not judg by what allah ha reveal then it is those who are the wrongdoer
  5| 46| and we sent follow in their footstep jesu the son of mari confirm that which came befor him in the torah and we gave him the gospel in which wa guidanc and light and confirm that which preced it of the torah as guidanc and instruct for the righteou
  5| 47| and let the peopl of the gospel judg by what allah ha reveal therein and whoever doe not judg by what allah ha reveal then it is those who are the defiantli disobedi
  5| 48| and we have reveal to you o muhammad the book in truth confirm that which preced it of the scriptur and as a criterion over it so judg between them by what allah ha reveal and do not follow their inclin away from what ha come to you of the truth to each of you we prescrib a law and a method had allah will he would have made you one nation unit in religion but he intend to test you in what he ha given you so race to all that is good to allah is your return all togeth and he will then inform you concern that over which you use to differ
  5| 49| and judg o muhammad between them by what allah ha reveal and do not follow their inclin and bewar of them lest they tempt you away from some of what allah ha reveal to you and if they turn away then know that allah onli intend to afflict them with some of their own sin and inde mani among the peopl are defiantli disobedi
  5| 50| then is it the judgement of the time of ignor they desir but who is better than allah in judgement for a peopl who are certain in faith
  5| 51| o you who have believ do not take the jew and the christian as alli they are in fact alli of one anoth and whoever is an alli to them among you then inde he is one of them inde allah guid not the wrongdo peopl
  5| 52| so you see those in whose heart is diseas hasten into associ with them say we are afraid a misfortun may strike us but perhap allah will bring conquest or a decis from him and they will becom over what they have been conceal within themselv regret
  5| 53| and those who believ will say are these the one who swore by allah their strongest oath that inde they were with you their deed have becom worthless and they have becom loser
  5| 54| o you who have believ whoever of you should revert from hi religion allah will bring forth in place of them a peopl he will love and who will love him who are humbl toward the believ power against the disbeliev they strive in the caus of allah and do not fear the blame of a critic that is the favor of allah he bestow it upon whom he will and allah is allencompass and know
  5| 55| your alli is none but allah and therefor hi messeng and those who have believ those who establish prayer and give zakah and they bow in worship
  5| 56| and whoever is an alli of allah and hi messeng and those who have believ inde the parti of allah they will be the predomin
  5| 57| o you who have believ take not those who have taken your religion in ridicul and amus among the one who were given the scriptur befor you nor the disbeliev as alli and fear allah if you should truli be believ
  5| 58| and when you call to prayer they take it in ridicul and amus that is becaus they are a peopl who do not use reason
  5| 59| say o peopl of the scriptur do you resent us except for the fact that we have believ in allah and what wa reveal to us and what wa reveal befor and becaus most of you are defiantli disobedi
  5| 60| say shall i inform you of what is wors than that as penalti from allah it is that of those whom allah ha curs and with whom he becam angri and made of them ape and pig and slave of taghut those are wors in posit and further astray from the sound way
  5| 61| and when they come to you they say we believ but they have enter with disbelief in their heart and they have certainli left with it and allah is most know of what they were conceal

  5| 65| and if onli the peopl of the scriptur had believ and fear allah we would have remov from them their misde and admit them to garden of pleasur
  5| 66| and if onli they upheld the law of the torah the gospel and what ha been reveal to them from their lord they would have consum provis from abov them and from beneath their feet among them are a moder commun but mani of them evil is that which they do
  5| 67| o messeng announc that which ha been reveal to you from your lord and if you do not then you have not convey hi messag and allah will protect you from the peopl inde allah doe not guid the disbeliev peopl

  5| 69| inde those who have believ in prophet muhammad and those befor him who were jew or sabean or christian those among them who believ in allah and the last day and did righteous no fear will there be concern them nor will they griev
  5| 70| we had alreadi taken the coven of the children of israel and had sent to them messeng whenev there came to them a messeng with what their soul did not desir a parti of messeng they deni and anoth parti they kill
  5| 71| and they thought there would be no result punish so they becam blind and deaf then allah turn to them in forgiv then again mani of them becam blind and deaf and allah is see of what they do
  5| 72| they have certainli disbeliev who say allah is the messiah the son of mari while the messiah ha said o children of israel worship allah my lord and your lord inde he who associ other with allah allah ha forbidden him paradis and hi refug is the fire and there are not for the wrongdoer ani helper
  5| 73| they have certainli disbeliev who say allah is the third of three and there is no god except one god and if they do not desist from what they are say there will sure afflict the disbeliev among them a pain punish
  5| 74| so will they not repent to allah and seek hi forgiv and allah is forgiv and merci
  5| 75| the messiah son of mari wa not but a messeng other messeng have pass on befor him and hi mother wa a support of truth they both use to eat food look how we make clear to them the sign then look how they are delud
  5| 76| say do you worship besid allah that which hold for you no power of harm or benefit while it is allah who is the hear the know
  5| 77| say o peopl of the scriptur do not exceed limit in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclin of a peopl who had gone astray befor and misl mani and have stray from the sound of the way
  5| 78| curs were those who disbeliev among the children of israel by the tongu of david and of jesu the son of mari that wa becaus they disobey and habitu transgress
  5| 79| they use not to prevent one anoth from wrongdo that they did how wretch wa that which they were do
  5| 80| you see mani of them becom alli of those who disbeliev how wretch is that which they have put forth for themselv in that allah ha becom angri with them and in the punish they will abid etern
  5| 81| and if they had believ in allah and the prophet and in what wa reveal to him they would not have taken them as alli but mani of them are defiantli disobedi
  5| 82| you will sure find the most intens of the peopl in animos toward the believ to be the jew and those who associ other with allah and you will find the nearest of them in affect to the believ those who say we are christian that is becaus among them are priest and monk and becaus they are not arrog
  5| 83| and when they hear what ha been reveal to the messeng you see their eye overflow with tear becaus of what they have recogn of the truth they say our lord we have believ so regist us among the wit
  5| 84| and whi should we not believ in allah and what ha come to us of the truth and we aspir that our lord will admit us to paradis with the righteou peopl
  5| 85| so allah reward them for what they said with garden in paradis beneath which river flow wherein they abid etern and that is the reward of doer of good
  5| 86| but those who disbeliev and deni our sign they are the companion of hellfir
  5| 87| o you who have believ do not prohibit the good thing which allah ha made law to you and do not transgress inde allah doe not like transgressor
  5| 88| and eat of what allah ha provid for you which is law and good and fear allah in whom you are believ
  5| 89| allah will not impos blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oath but he will impos blame upon you for break what you intend of oath so it expiat is the feed of ten needi peopl from the averag of that which you feed your own famili or cloth them or the free of a slave but whoever can not find or afford it then a fast of three day is requir that is the expiat for oath when you have sworn but guard your oath thu doe allah make clear to you hi vers that you may be grate
  5| 90| o you who have believ inde intoxic gambl sacrif on stone alter to other than allah and divin arrow are but defil from the work of satan so avoid it that you may be success
  5| 91| satan onli want to caus between you animos and hatr through intoxic and gambl and to avert you from the remembr of allah and from prayer so will you not desist
  5| 92| and obey allah and obey the messeng and bewar and if you turn away then know that upon our messeng is onli the respons for clear notif
  5| 93| there is not upon those who believ and do righteous ani blame concern what they have eaten in the past if they now fear allah and believ and do righteou deed and then fear allah and believ and then fear allah and do good and allah love the doer of good
  5| 94| o you who have believ allah will sure test you through someth of the game that your hand and spear can reach that allah may make evid those who fear him unseen and whoever transgress after that for him is a pain punish
  5| 95| o you who have believ do not kill game while you are in the state of ihram and whoever of you kill it intent the penalti is an equival from sacrifici anim to what he kill as judg by two just men among you as an offer to allah deliv to the kabah or an expiat the feed of needi peopl or the equival of that in fast that he may tast the consequ of hi deed allah ha pardon what is past but whoever return to violat then allah will take retribut from him and allah is exalt in might and owner of retribut
  5| 96| law to you is game from the sea and it food as provis for you and the travel but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of ihram and fear allah to whom you will be gather
  5| 97| allah ha made the kabah the sacr hous stand for the peopl and ha sanctifi the sacr month and the sacrifici anim and the garland by which they are identifi that is so you may know that allah know what is in the heaven and what is in the earth and that allah is know of all thing
  5| 98| know that allah is sever in penalti and that allah is forgiv and merci
  5| 99| not upon the messeng is respons except for notif and allah know whatev you reveal and whatev you conceal
  5|100| say not equal are the evil and the good although the abund of evil might impress you so fear allah o you of understand that you may be success
  5|101| o you who have believ do not ask about thing which if they are shown to you will distress you but if you ask about them while the quran is be reveal they will be shown to you allah ha pardon that which is past and allah is forgiv and forbear
  5|102| a peopl ask such question befor you then they becam therebi disbeliev
  5|103| allah ha not appoint such innov as bahirah or saibah or wasilah or ham but those who disbeliev invent falsehood about allah and most of them do not reason
  5|104| and when it is said to them come to what allah ha reveal and to the messeng they say suffici for us is that upon which we found our father even though their father knew noth nor were they guid
  5|105| o you who have believ upon you is respons for yourselv those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guid to allah is you return all togeth then he will inform you of what you use to do
  5|106| o you who have believ testimoni should be taken among you when death approach one of you at the time of bequest that of two just men from among you or two other from outsid if you are travel through the land and the disast of death should strike you detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by allah if you doubt their testimoni say we will not exchang our oath for a price even if he should be a near rel and we will not withhold the testimoni of allah inde we would then be of the sin
  5|107| but if it is found that those two were guilti of perjuri let two other stand in their place who are foremost in claim from those who have a law right and let them swear by allah our testimoni is truer than their testimoni and we have not transgress inde we would then be of the wrongdoer
  5|108| that is more like that they will give testimoni accord to it true object or at least they would fear that other oath might be taken after their oath and fear allah and listen and allah doe not guid the defiantli disobedi peopl
  5|109| be warn of the day when allah will assembl the messeng and say what wa the respons you receiv they will say we have no knowledg inde it is you who is knower of the unseen
  5|110| the day when allah will say o jesu son of mari rememb my favor upon you and upon your mother when i support you with the pure spirit and you spoke to the peopl in the cradl and in matur and rememb when i taught you write and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and when you design from clay what wa like the form of a bird with my permiss then you breath into it and it becam a bird with my permiss and you heal the blind and the leper with my permiss and when you brought forth the dead with my permiss and when i restrain the children of israel from kill you when you came to them with clear proof and those who disbeliev among them said thi is not but obviou magic
  5|111| and rememb when i inspir to the discipl believ in me and in my messeng jesu they said we have believ so bear wit that inde we are muslim in submiss to allah
  5|112| and rememb when the discipl said o jesu son of mari can your lord send down to us a tabl spread with food from the heaven jesu said fear allah if you should be believ

  5|114| said jesu the son of mari o allah our lord send down to us a tabl spread with food from the heaven to be for us a festiv for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from you and provid for us and you are the best of provid
  5|115| allah said inde i will sent it down to you but whoever disbeliev afterward from among you then inde will i punish him with a punish by which i have not punish anyon among the world
  5|116| and bewar the day when allah will say o jesu son of mari did you say to the peopl take me and my mother as deiti besid allah he will say exalt are you it wa not for me to say that to which i have no right if i had said it you would have known it you know what is within myself and i do not know what is within yourself inde it is you who is knower of the unseen
  5|117| i said not to them except what you command me to worship allah my lord and your lord and i wa a wit over them as long as i wa among them but when you took me up you were the observ over them and you are over all thing wit
  5|118| if you should punish them inde they are your servant but if you forgiv them inde it is you who is the exalt in might the wise
  5|119| allah will say thi is the day when the truth will benefit from their truth for them are garden in paradis beneath which river flow wherein they will abid forev allah be pleas with them and they with him that is the great attain
  5|120| to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and whatev is within them and he is over all thing compet
  6|  1| all prais is due to allah who creat the heaven and the earth and made the dark and the light then those who disbeliev equat other with their lord
  6|  2| it is he who creat you from clay and then decre a term and a specifi time known to him then still you are in disput
  6|  3| and he is allah the onli deiti in the heaven and the earth he know your secret and what you make public and he know that which you earn
  6|  4| and no sign come to them from the sign of their lord except that they turn away therefrom
  6|  5| for they had deni the truth when it came to them but there is go to reach them the news of what they use to ridicul
  6|  6| have they not seen how mani gener we destroy befor them which we had establish upon the earth as we have not establish you and we sent rain from the sky upon them in shower and made river flow beneath them then we destroy them for their sin and brought forth after them a gener of other
  6|  7| and even if we had sent down to you o muhammad a written scriptur on a page and they touch it with their hand the disbeliev would say thi is not but obviou magic
  6|  8| and they say whi wa there not sent down to him an angel but if we had sent down an angel the matter would have been decid then they would not be repriev
  6|  9| and if we had made him an angel we would have made him appear as a man and we would have cover them with that in which they cover themselv
  6| 10| and alreadi were messeng ridicul befor you but those who mock them were envelop by that which they use to ridicul
  6| 11| say travel through the land then observ how wa the end of the denier
  6| 12| say to whom belong whatev is in the heaven and earth say to allah he ha decre upon himself merci he will sure assembl you for the day of resurrect about which there is no doubt those who will lose themselv that day do not believ
  6| 13| and to him belong that which repos by night and by day and he is the hear the know
  6| 14| say is it other than allah i should take as a protector creator of the heaven and the earth while it is he who feed and is not fed say o muhammad inde i have been command to be the first among you who submit to allah and wa command do not ever be of the polytheist
  6| 15| say inde i fear if i should disobey my lord the punish of a tremend day
  6| 16| he from whom it is avert that day allah ha grant him merci and that is the clear attain
  6| 17| and if allah should touch you with advers there is no remov of it except him and if he touch you with good then he is over all thing compet
  6| 18| and he is the subjug over hi servant and he is the wise the acquaint with all
  6| 19| say what thing is greatest in testimoni say allah is wit between me and you and thi quran wa reveal to me that i may warn you therebi and whomev it reach do you truli testifi that with allah there are other deiti say i will not testifi with you say inde he is but one god and inde i am free of what you associ with him
  6| 20| those to whom we have given the scriptur recogn it as they recogn their own son those who will lose themselv in the hereaft do not believ
  6| 21| and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah a lie or deni hi vers inde the wrongdoer will not succeed
  6| 22| and mention o muhammad the day we will gather them all togeth then we will say to those who associ other with allah where are your partner that you use to claim with him
  6| 23| then there will be no excus upon examin except they will say by allah our lord we were not those who associ
  6| 24| see how they will lie about themselv and lost from them will be what they use to invent
  6| 25| and among them are those who listen to you but we have place over their heart cover lest they understand it and in their ear deaf and if they should see everi sign they will not believ in it even when they come to you argu with you those who disbeliev say thi is not but legend of the former peopl
  6| 26| and they prevent other from him and are themselv remot from him and they do not destroy except themselv but they perceiv it not
  6| 27| if you could but see when they are made to stand befor the fire and will say oh would that we could be return to life on earth and not deni the sign of our lord and be among the believ
  6| 28| but what they conceal befor ha now appear to them and even if they were return they would return to that which they were forbidden and inde they are liar
  6| 29| and they say there is none but our worldli life and we will not be resurrect
  6| 30| if you could but see when they will be made to stand befor their lord he will say is thi not the truth they will say ye by our lord he will then say so tast the punish becaus you use to disbeliev
  6| 31| those will have lost who deni the meet with allah until when the hour of resurrect come upon them unexpectedli they will say oh how great is our regret over what we neglect concern it while they bear their burden on their back unquestion evil is that which they bear
  6| 32| and the worldli life is not but amus and divers but the home of the hereaft is best for those who fear allah so will you not reason
  6| 33| we know that you o muhammad are sadden by what they say and inde they do not call you untruth but it is the vers of allah that the wrongdoer reject
  6| 34| and certainli were messeng deni befor you but they were patient over the effect of denial and they were harm until our victori came to them and none can alter the word of allah and there ha certainli come to you some inform about the previou messeng
  6| 35| and if their evas is difficult for you then if you are abl to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign then do so but if allah had will he would have unit them upon guidanc so never be of the ignor
  6| 36| onli those who hear will respond but the dead allah will resurrect them then to him they will be return
  6| 37| and they say whi ha a sign not been sent down to him from hi lord say inde allah is abl to send down a sign but most of them do not know
  6| 38| and there is no creatur on or within the earth or bird that fli with it wing except that they are commun like you we have not neglect in the regist a thing then unto their lord they will be gather
  6| 39| but those who deni our vers are deaf and dumb within dark whomev allah will he leav astray and whomev he will he put him on a straight path
  6| 40| say have you consid if there came to you the punish of allah or there came to you the hour is it other than allah you would invok if you should be truth
  6| 41| no it is him alon you would invok and he would remov that for which you invok him if he will and you would forget what you associ with him
  6| 42| and we have alreadi sent messeng to nation befor you o muhammad then we seiz them with poverti and hardship that perhap they might humbl themselv to us
  6| 43| then whi when our punish came to them did they not humbl themselv but their heart becam harden and satan made attract to them that which they were do
  6| 44| so when they forgot that by which they had been remind we open to them the door of everi good thing until when they rejoic in that which they were given we seiz them suddenli and they were then in despair
  6| 45| so the peopl that commit wrong were elimin and prais to allah lord of the world
  6| 46| say have you consid if allah should take away your hear and your sight and set a seal upon your heart which deiti other than allah could bring them back to you look how we diversifi the vers then they still turn away
  6| 47| say have you consid if the punish of allah should come to you unexpectedli or manifestli will ani be destroy but the wrongdo peopl
  6| 48| and we send not the messeng except as bringer of good tide and warner so whoever believ and reform there will be no fear concern them nor will they griev
  6| 49| but those who deni our vers the punish will touch them for their defiant disobedi
  6| 50| say o muhammad i do not tell you that i have the depositori contain the provis of allah or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel i onli follow what is reveal to me say is the blind equival to the see then will you not give thought
  6| 51| and warn by the quran those who fear that they will be gather befor their lord for them besid him will be no protector and no intercessor that they might becom righteou
  6| 52| and do not send away those who call upon their lord morn and afternoon seek hi counten not upon you is anyth of their account and not upon them is anyth of your account so were you to send them away you would then be of the wrongdoer
  6| 53| and thu we have tri some of them through other that the disbeliev might say is it these whom allah ha favor among us is not allah most know of those who are grate
  6| 54| and when those come to you who believ in our vers say peac be upon you your lord ha decre upon himself merci that ani of you who doe wrong out of ignor and then repent after that and correct himself inde he is forgiv and merci
  6| 55| and thu do we detail the vers and thu the way of the crimin will becom evid
  6| 56| say inde i have been forbidden to worship those you invok besid allah say i will not follow your desir for i would then have gone astray and i would not be of the rightli guid
  6| 57| say inde i am on clear evid from my lord and you have deni it i do not have that for which you are impati the decis is onli for allah he relat the truth and he is the best of decid
  6| 58| say if i had that for which you are impati the matter would have been decid between me and you but allah is most know of the wrongdoer
  6| 59| and with him are the key of the unseen none know them except him and he know what is on the land and in the sea not a leaf fall but that he know it and no grain is there within the dark of the earth and no moist or dri thing but that it is written in a clear record
  6| 60| and it is he who take your soul by night and know what you have commit by day then he reviv you therein that a specifi term may be fulfil then to him will be your return then he will inform you about what you use to do
  6| 61| and he is the subjug over hi servant and he send over you guardianangel until when death come to one of you our messeng take him and they do not fail in their duti
  6| 62| then they hi servant are return to allah their true lord unquestion hi is the judgement and he is the swiftest of account
  6| 63| say who rescu you from the dark of the land and sea when you call upon him implor aloud and privat if he should save us from thi crisi we will sure be among the thank
  6| 64| say it is allah who save you from it and from everi distress then you still associ other with him
  6| 65| say he is the one abl to send upon you afflict from abov you or from beneath your feet or to confus you so you becom sect and make you tast the violenc of one anoth look how we diversifi the sign that they might understand
  6| 66| but your peopl have deni it while it is the truth say i am not over you a manag
  6| 67| for everi happen is a final and you are go to know
  6| 68| and when you see those who engag in offens discours concern our vers then turn away from them until they enter into anoth convers and if satan should caus you to forget then do not remain after the remind with the wrongdo peopl
  6| 69| and those who fear allah are not held account for the disbeliev at all but onli for a remind that perhap they will fear him
  6| 70| and leav those who take their religion as amus and divers and whom the worldli life ha delud but remind with the quran lest a soul be given up to destruct for what it earn it will have other than allah no protector and no intercessor and if it should offer everi compens it would not be taken from it those are the one who are given to destruct for what they have earn for them will be a drink of scald water and a pain punish becaus they use to disbeliev
  6| 71| say shall we invok instead of allah that which neither benefit us nor harm us and be turn back on our heel after allah ha guid us we would then be like one whom the devil entic to wander upon the earth confus while he ha companion invit him to guidanc call come to us say inde the guidanc of allah is the onli guidanc and we have been command to submit to the lord of the world
  6| 72| and to establish prayer and fear him and it is he to whom you will be gather
  6| 73| and it is he who creat the heaven and earth in truth and the day he say be and it is hi word is the truth and hi is the dominion on the day the horn is blown he is knower of the unseen and the wit and he is the wise the acquaint
  6| 74| and mention o muhammad when abraham said to hi father azar do you take idol as deiti inde i see you and your peopl to be in manifest error
  6| 75| and thu did we show abraham the realm of the heaven and the earth that he would be among the certain in faith
  6| 76| so when the night cover him with dark he saw a star he said thi is my lord but when it set he said i like not those that disappear
  6| 77| and when he saw the moon rise he said thi is my lord but when it set he said unless my lord guid me i will sure be among the peopl gone astray
  6| 78| and when he saw the sun rise he said thi is my lord thi is greater but when it set he said o my peopl inde i am free from what you associ with allah
  6| 79| inde i have turn my face toward he who creat the heaven and the earth inclin toward truth and i am not of those who associ other with allah
  6| 80| and hi peopl argu with him he said do you argu with me concern allah while he ha guid me and i fear not what you associ with him and will not be harm unless my lord should will someth my lord encompass all thing in knowledg then will you not rememb
  6| 81| and how should i fear what you associ while you do not fear that you have associ with allah that for which he ha not sent down to you ani author so which of the two parti ha more right to secur if you should know
  6| 82| they who believ and do not mix their belief with injustic those will have secur and they are rightli guid
  6| 83| and that wa our conclus argument which we gave abraham against hi peopl we rais by degre whom we will inde your lord is wise and know
  6| 84| and we gave to abraham isaac and jacob all of them we guid and noah we guid befor and among hi descend david and solomon and job and joseph and mose and aaron thu do we reward the doer of good
  6| 85| and zechariah and john and jesu and elia and all were of the righteou
  6| 86| and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot and all of them we prefer over the world
  6| 87| and some among their father and their descend and their brother and we chose them and we guid them to a straight path
  6| 88| that is the guidanc of allah by which he guid whomev he will of hi servant but if they had associ other with allah then worthless for them would be whatev they were do
  6| 89| those are the one to whom we gave the scriptur and author and prophethood but if the disbeliev deni it then we have entrust it to a peopl who are not therein disbeliev
  6| 90| those are the one whom allah ha guid so from their guidanc take an exampl say i ask of you for thi messag no payment it is not but a remind for the world
  6| 91| and they did not apprais allah with true apprais when they said allah did not reveal to a human be anyth say who reveal the scriptur that mose brought as light and guidanc to the peopl you jew make it into page disclos some of it and conceal much and you were taught that which you knew not neither you nor your father say allah reveal it then leav them in their empti discours amus themselv
  6| 92| and thi is a book which we have sent down bless and confirm what wa befor it that you may warn the mother of citi and those around it those who believ in the hereaft believ in it and they are maintain their prayer
  6| 93| and who is more unjust than one who invent a lie about allah or say it ha been inspir to me while noth ha been inspir to him and one who say i will reveal someth like what allah reveal and if you could but see when the wrongdoer are in the overwhelm pang of death while the angel extend their hand say discharg your soul today you will be award the punish of extrem humili for what you use to say against allah other than the truth and that you were toward hi vers be arrog

  6| 98| and it is he who produc you from one soul and gave you a place of dwell and of storag we have detail the sign for a peopl who understand
  6| 99| and it is he who send down rain from the sky and we produc therebi the growth of all thing we produc from it greeneri from which we produc grain arrang in layer and from the palm tree of it emerg fruit are cluster hang low and we produc garden of grapevin and oliv and pomegran similar yet vari look at each of it fruit when it yield and at it ripen inde in that are sign for a peopl who believ
  6|100| but they have attribut to allah partner the jinn while he ha creat them and have fabric for him son and daughter exalt is he and high abov what they describ
  6|101| he is origin of the heaven and the earth how could he have a son when he doe not have a companion and he creat all thing and he is of all thing know
  6|102| that is allah your lord there is no deiti except him the creator of all thing so worship him and he is dispos of all thing
  6|103| vision perceiv him not but he perceiv all vision and he is the subtl the acquaint
  6|104| there ha come to you enlighten from your lord so whoever will see doe so for the benefit of hi soul and whoever is blind doe harm against it and say i am not a guardian over you
  6|105| and thu do we diversifi the vers so the disbeliev will say you have studi and so we may make the quran clear for a peopl who know
  6|106| follow o muhammad what ha been reveal to you from your lord there is no deiti except him and turn away from those who associ other with allah
  6|107| but if allah had will they would not have associ and we have not appoint you over them as a guardian nor are you a manag over them
  6|108| and do not insult those they invok other than allah lest they insult allah in enmiti without knowledg thu we have made pleas to everi commun their deed then to their lord is their return and he will inform them about what they use to do
  6|109| and they swear by allah their strongest oath that if a sign came to them they would sure believ in it say the sign are onli with allah and what will make you perceiv that even if a sign came they would not believ
  6|110| and we will turn away their heart and their eye just as they refus to believ in it the first time and we will leav them in their transgress wander blindli
  6|111| and even if we had sent down to them the angel with the messag and the dead spoke to them of it and we gather togeth everi creat thing in front of them they would not believ unless allah should will but most of them of that are ignor
  6|112| and thu we have made for everi prophet an enemi devil from mankind and jinn inspir to one anoth decor speech in delus but if your lord had will they would not have done it so leav them and that which they invent
  6|113| and it is so the heart of those who disbeliev in the hereaft will inclin toward it and that they will be satisfi with it and that they will commit that which they are commit
  6|114| say then is it other than allah i should seek as judg while it is he who ha reveal to you the book explain in detail and those to whom we previous gave the scriptur know that it is sent down from your lord in truth so never be among the doubter
  6|115| and the word of your lord ha been fulfil in truth and in justic none can alter hi word and he is the hear the know
  6|116| and if you obey most of those upon the earth they will mislead you from the way of allah they follow not except assumpt and they are not but falsifi
  6|117| inde your lord is most know of who stray from hi way and he is most know of the rightli guid
  6|118| so eat of that meat upon which the name of allah ha been mention if you are believ in hi vers
  6|119| and whi should you not eat of that upon which the name of allah ha been mention while he ha explain in detail to you what he ha forbidden you except that to which you are compel and inde do mani lead other astray through their own inclin without knowledg inde your lord he is most know of the transgressor
  6|120| and leav what is appar of sin and what is conceal thereof inde those who earn blame for sin will be recompens for that which they use to commit
  6|121| and do not eat of that upon which the name of allah ha not been mention for inde it is grave disobedi and inde do the devil inspir their alli among men to disput with you and if you were to obey them inde you would be associ of other with him
  6|122| and is one who wa dead and we gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the peopl like one who is in dark never to emerg therefrom thu it ha been made pleas to the disbeliev that which they were do
  6|123| and thu we have place within everi citi the greatest of it crimin to conspir therein but they conspir not except against themselv and they perceiv it not
  6|124| and when a sign come to them they say never will we believ until we are given like that which wa given to the messeng of allah allah is most know of where he place hi messag there will afflict those who commit crime debas befor allah and sever punish for what they use to conspir
  6|125| so whoever allah want to guid he expand hi breast to contain islam and whoever he want to misguid he make hi breast tight and constrict as though he were climb into the sky thu doe allah place defil upon those who do not believ
  6|126| and thi is the path of your lord lead straight we have detail the vers for a peopl who rememb
  6|127| for them will be the home of peac with their lord and he will be their protect friend becaus of what they use to do
  6|128| and mention o muhammad the day when he will gather them togeth and say o compani of jinn you have misl mani of mankind and their alli among mankind will say our lord some of us made use of other and we have now reach our term which you appoint for us he will say the fire is your resid wherein you will abid etern except for what allah will inde your lord is wise and know
  6|129| and thu will we make some of the wrongdoer alli of other for what they use to earn
  6|130| o compani of jinn and mankind did there not come to you messeng from among you relat to you my vers and warn you of the meet of thi day of your they will say we bear wit against ourselv and the worldli life had delud them and they will bear wit against themselv that they were disbeliev
  6|131| that is becaus your lord would not destroy the citi for wrongdo while their peopl were unawar
  6|132| and for all are degre from what they have done and your lord is not unawar of what they do
  6|133| and your lord is the free of need the possessor of merci if he will he can do away with you and give success after you to whomev he will just as he produc you from the descend of anoth peopl
  6|134| inde what you are promis is come and you will not caus failur to allah
  6|135| say o my peopl work accord to your posit for inde i am work and you are go to know who will have success in the home inde the wrongdoer will not succeed
  6|136| and the polytheist assign to allah from that which he creat of crop and livestock a share and say thi is for allah by their claim and thi is for our partner associ with him but what is for their partner doe not reach allah while what is for allah thi reach their partner evil is that which they rule
  6|137| and likewis to mani of the polytheist their partner have made to seem pleas the kill of their children in order to bring about their destruct and to cover them with confus in their religion and if allah had will they would not have done so so leav them and that which they invent
  6|138| and they say these anim and crop are forbidden no one may eat from them except whom we will by their claim and there are those camel whose back are forbidden by them and those upon which the name of allah is not mention all of thi an invent of untruth about him he will punish them for what they were invent
  6|139| and they say what is in the belli of these anim is exclus for our male and forbidden to our femal but if it is born dead then all of them have share therein he will punish them for their descript inde he is wise and know
  6|140| those will have lost who kill their children in foolish without knowledg and prohibit what allah had provid for them invent untruth about allah they have gone astray and were not rightli guid
  6|141| and he it is who caus garden to grow both trellis and untrellis and palm tree and crop of differ kind of food and oliv and pomegran similar and dissimilar eat of each of it fruit when it yield and give it due zakah on the day of it harvest and be not excess inde he doe not like those who commit excess
  6|142| and of the graze livestock are carrier of burden and those too small eat of what allah ha provid for you and do not follow the footstep of satan inde he is to you a clear enemi
  6|143| they are eight mate of the sheep two and of the goat two say is it the two male he ha forbidden or the two femal or that which the womb of the two femal contain inform me with knowledg if you should be truth
  6|144| and of the camel two and of the cattl two say is it the two male he ha forbidden or the two femal or that which the womb of the two femal contain or were you wit when allah charg you with thi then who is more unjust than one who invent a lie about allah to mislead the peopl by someth other than knowledg inde allah doe not guid the wrongdo peopl
  6|145| say i do not find within that which wa reveal to me anyth forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead anim or blood spill out or the flesh of swine for inde it is impur or it be that slaughter in disobedi dedic to other than allah but whoever is forc by necess neither desir it nor transgress it limit then inde your lord is forgiv and merci
  6|146| and to those who are jew we prohibit everi anim of uncloven hoof and of the cattl and the sheep we prohibit to them their fat except what adher to their back or the entrail or what is join with bone by that we repaid them for their injustic and inde we are truth
  6|147| so if they deni you o muhammad say your lord is the possessor of vast merci but hi punish can not be repel from the peopl who are crimin
  6|148| those who associ with allah will say if allah had will we would not have associ anyth and neither would our father nor would we have prohibit anyth likewis did those befor deni until they tast our punish say do you have ani knowledg that you can produc for us you follow not except assumpt and you are not but falsifi
  6|149| say with allah is the farreach argument if he had will he would have guid you all
  6|150| say o muhammad bring forward your wit who will testifi that allah ha prohibit thi and if they testifi do not testifi with them and do not follow the desir of those who deni our vers and those who do not believ in the hereaft while they equat other with their lord
  6|151| say come i will recit what your lord ha prohibit to you he command that you not associ anyth with him and to parent good treatment and do not kill your children out of poverti we will provid for you and them and do not approach immor what is appar of them and what is conceal and do not kill the soul which allah ha forbidden to be kill except by legal right thi ha he instruct you that you may use reason
  6|152| and do not approach the orphan properti except in a way that is best until he reach matur and give full measur and weight in justic we do not charg ani soul except with that within it capac and when you testifi be just even if it concern a near rel and the coven of allah fulfil thi ha he instruct you that you may rememb
  6|153| and moreov thi is my path which is straight so follow it and do not follow other way for you will be separ from hi way thi ha he instruct you that you may becom righteou
  6|154| then we gave mose the scriptur make complet our favor upon the one who did good and as a detail explan of all thing and as guidanc and merci that perhap in the matter of the meet with their lord they would believ
  6|155| and thi quran is a book we have reveal which is bless so follow it and fear allah that you may receiv merci
  6|156| we reveal it lest you say the scriptur wa onli sent down to two group befor us but we were of their studi unawar
  6|157| or lest you say if onli the scriptur had been reveal to us we would have been better guid than they so there ha now come to you a clear evid from your lord and a guidanc and merci then who is more unjust than one who deni the vers of allah and turn away from them we will recompens those who turn away from our vers with the worst of punish for their have turn away
  6|158| do they then wait for anyth except that the angel should come to them or your lord should come or that there come some of the sign of your lord the day that some of the sign of your lord will come no soul will benefit from it faith as long as it had not believ befor or had earn through it faith some good say wait inde we also are wait
  6|159| inde those who have divid their religion and becom sect you o muhammad are not associ with them in anyth their affair is onli left to allah then he will inform them about what they use to do
  6|160| whoever come on the day of judgement with a good deed will have ten time the like thereof to hi credit and whoever come with an evil deed will not be recompens except the like thereof and they will not be wrong
  6|161| say inde my lord ha guid me to a straight path a correct religion the way of abraham inclin toward truth and he wa not among those who associ other with allah
  6|162| say inde my prayer my rite of sacrific my live and my die are for allah lord of the world
  6|163| no partner ha he and thi i have been command and i am the first among you of the muslim
  6|164| say is it other than allah i should desir as a lord while he is the lord of all thing and everi soul earn not blame except against itself and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of anoth then to your lord is your return and he will inform you concern that over which you use to differ
  6|165| and it is he who ha made you successor upon the earth and ha rais some of you abov other in degre of rank that he may tri you through what he ha given you inde your lord is swift in penalti but inde he is forgiv and merci
  7|  1| alif lam meem sad

  7|  3| follow o mankind what ha been reveal to you from your lord and do not follow other than him ani alli littl do you rememb
  7|  4| and how mani citi have we destroy and our punish came to them at night or while they were sleep at noon
  7|  5| and their declar when our punish came to them wa onli that they said inde we were wrongdoer
  7|  6| then we will sure question those to whom a messag wa sent and we will sure question the messeng
  7|  7| then we will sure relat their deed to them with knowledg and we were not at all absent
  7|  8| and the weigh of deed that day will be the truth so those whose scale are heavi it is they who will be the success
  7|  9| and those whose scale are light they are the one who will lose themselv for what injustic they were do toward our vers
  7| 10| and we have certainli establish you upon the earth and made for you therein way of livelihood littl are you grate
  7| 11| and we have certainli creat you o mankind and given you human form then we said to the angel prostrat to adam so they prostrat except for ible he wa not of those who prostrat
  7| 12| allah said what prevent you from prostrat when i command you satan said i am better than him you creat me from fire and creat him from clay
  7| 13| allah said descend from paradis for it is not for you to be arrog therein so get out inde you are of the debas
  7| 14| satan said repriev me until the day they are resurrect
  7| 15| allah said inde you are of those repriev
  7| 16| satan said becaus you have put me in error i will sure sit in wait for them on your straight path
  7| 17| then i will come to them from befor them and from behind them and on their right and on their left and you will not find most of them grate to you
  7| 18| allah said get out of paradis reproach and expel whoever follow you among them i will sure fill hell with you all togeth
  7| 19| and o adam dwell you and your wife in paradis and eat from wherev you will but do not approach thi tree lest you be among the wrongdoer
  7| 20| but satan whisper to them to make appar to them that which wa conceal from them of their privat part he said your lord did not forbid you thi tree except that you becom angel or becom of the immort
  7| 21| and he swore by allah to them inde i am to you from among the sincer advisor
  7| 22| so he made them fall through decept and when they tast of the tree their privat part becam appar to them and they began to fasten togeth over themselv from the leav of paradis and their lord call to them did i not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is to you a clear enemi
  7| 23| they said our lord we have wrong ourselv and if you do not forgiv us and have merci upon us we will sure be among the loser
  7| 24| allah said descend be to one anoth enemi and for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoy for a time
  7| 25| he said therein you will live and therein you will die and from it you will be brought forth
  7| 26| o children of adam we have bestow upon you cloth to conceal your privat part and as adorn but the cloth of righteous that is best that is from the sign of allah that perhap they will rememb
  7| 27| o children of adam let not satan tempt you as he remov your parent from paradis strip them of their cloth to show them their privat part inde he see you he and hi tribe from where you do not see them inde we have made the devil alli to those who do not believ
  7| 28| and when they commit an immor they say we found our father do it and allah ha order us to do it say inde allah doe not order immor do you say about allah that which you do not know
  7| 29| say o muhammad my lord ha order justic and that you maintain yourselv in worship of him at everi place or time of prostrat and invok him sincer to him in religion just as he origin you you will return to life
  7| 30| a group of you he guid and a group deserv to be in error inde they had taken the devil as alli instead of allah while they thought that they were guid
  7| 31| o children of adam take your adorn at everi masjid and eat and drink but be not excess inde he like not those who commit excess
  7| 32| say who ha forbidden the adorn of allah which he ha produc for hi servant and the good law thing of provis say they are for those who believ dure the worldli life but exclus for them on the day of resurrect thu do we detail the vers for a peopl who know
  7| 33| say my lord ha onli forbidden immor what is appar of them and what is conceal and sin and oppress without right and that you associ with allah that for which he ha not sent down author and that you say about allah that which you do not know
  7| 34| and for everi nation is a specifi term so when their time ha come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they preced it
  7| 35| o children of adam if there come to you messeng from among you relat to you my vers then whoever fear allah and reform there will be no fear concern them nor will they griev
  7| 36| but the one who deni our vers and are arrog toward them those are the companion of the fire they will abid therein etern
  7| 37| and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah a lie or deni hi vers those will attain their portion of the decre until when our messeng come to them to take them in death they will say where are those you use to invok besid allah they will say they have depart from us and will bear wit against themselv that they were disbeliev
  7| 38| allah will say enter among nation which had pass on befor you of jinn and mankind into the fire everi time a nation enter it will curs it sister until when they have all overtaken one anoth therein the last of them will say about the first of them our lord these had misl us so give them a doubl punish of the fire he will say for each is doubl but you do not know
  7| 39| and the first of them will say to the last of them then you had not ani favor over us so tast the punish for what you use to earn
  7| 40| inde those who deni our vers and are arrog toward them the gate of heaven will not be open for them nor will they enter paradis until a camel enter into the eye of a needl and thu do we recompens the crimin
  7| 41| they will have from hell a bed and over them cover of fire and thu do we recompens the wrongdoer
  7| 42| but those who believ and did righteou deed we charg no soul except within it capac those are the companion of paradis they will abid therein etern
  7| 43| and we will have remov whatev is within their breast of resent while flow beneath them are river and they will say prais to allah who ha guid us to thi and we would never have been guid if allah had not guid us certainli the messeng of our lord had come with the truth and they will be call thi is paradis which you have been made to inherit for what you use to do
  7| 44| and the companion of paradis will call out to the companion of the fire we have alreadi found what our lord promis us to be true have you found what your lord promis to be true they will say ye then an announc will announc among them the curs of allah shall be upon the wrongdoer
  7| 45| who avert peopl from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they were concern the hereaft disbeliev
  7| 46| and between them will be a partit and on it elev are men who recogn all by their mark and they call out to the companion of paradis peac be upon you they have not yet enter it but they long intens
  7| 47| and when their eye are turn toward the companion of the fire they say our lord do not place us with the wrongdo peopl
  7| 48| and the companion of the elev will call to men within hell whom they recogn by their mark say of no avail to you wa your gather and the fact that you were arrog
  7| 49| allah will say are these the one whom you inhabit of hell swore that allah would never offer them merci enter paradis o peopl of the elev no fear will there be concern you nor will you griev
  7| 50| and the companion of the fire will call to the companion of paradis pour upon us some water or from whatev allah ha provid you they will say inde allah ha forbidden them both to the disbeliev
  7| 51| who took their religion as distract and amus and whom the worldli life delud so today we will forget them just as they forgot the meet of thi day of their and for have reject our vers
  7| 52| and we had certainli brought them a book which we detail by knowledg as guidanc and merci to a peopl who believ
  7| 53| do they await except it result the day it result come those who had ignor it befor will say the messeng of our lord had come with the truth so are there now ani intercessor to interced for us or could we be sent back to do other than we use to do they will have lost themselv and lost from them is what they use to invent

  7| 58| and the good land it veget emerg by permiss of it lord but that which is bad noth emerg except spars with difficulti thu do we diversifi the sign for a peopl who are grate
  7| 59| we had certainli sent noah to hi peopl and he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him inde i fear for you the punish of a tremend day
  7| 60| said the emin among hi peopl inde we see you in clear error
  7| 61| noah said o my peopl there is not error in me but i am a messeng from the lord of the world
  7| 62| i convey to you the messag of my lord and advis you and i know from allah what you do not know
  7| 63| then do you wonder that there ha come to you a remind from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and that you may fear allah so you might receiv merci
  7| 64| but they deni him so we save him and those who were with him in the ship and we drown those who deni our sign inde they were a blind peopl
  7| 65| and to the aad we sent their brother hud he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him then will you not fear him
  7| 66| said the emin one who disbeliev among hi peopl inde we see you in foolish and inde we think you are of the liar

  7| 68| i convey to you the messag of my lord and i am to you a trustworthi advis
  7| 69| then do you wonder that there ha come to you a remind from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and rememb when he made you successor after the peopl of noah and increas you in statur extens so rememb the favor of allah that you might succeed
  7| 70| they said have you come to us that we should worship allah alon and leav what our father have worship then bring us what you promis us if you should be of the truth
  7| 71| hud said alreadi have defil and anger fallen upon you from your lord do you disput with me concern mere name you have name them you and your father for which allah ha not sent down ani author then wait inde i am with you among those who wait
  7| 72| so we save him and those with him by merci from us and we elimin those who deni our sign and they were not at all believ
  7| 73| and to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him there ha come to you clear evid from your lord thi is the shecamel of allah sent to you as a sign so leav her to eat within allah s land and do not touch her with harm lest there seiz you a pain punish

  7| 76| said those who were arrog inde we in that which you have believ are disbeliev
  7| 77| so they hamstrung the shecamel and were insol toward the command of their lord and said o salih bring us what you promis us if you should be of the messeng
  7| 78| so the earthquak seiz them and they becam within their home corps fallen prone
  7| 79| and he turn away from them and said o my peopl i had certainli convey to you the messag of my lord and advis you but you do not like advisor
  7| 80| and we had sent lot when he said to hi peopl do you commit such immor as no one ha preced you with from among the world

  7| 82| but the answer of hi peopl wa onli that they said evict them from your citi inde they are men who keep themselv pure
  7| 83| so we save him and hi famili except for hi wife she wa of those who remain with the evildo
  7| 84| and we rain upon them a rain of stone then see how wa the end of the crimin
  7| 85| and to the peopl of madyan we sent their brother shuayb he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him there ha come to you clear evid from your lord so fulfil the measur and weight and do not depriv peopl of their due and caus not corrupt upon the earth after it reform that is better for you if you should be believ

  7| 87| and if there should be a group among you who ha believ in that with which i have been sent and a group that ha not believ then be patient until allah judg between us and he is the best of judg
  7| 88| said the emin one who were arrog among hi peopl we will sure evict you o shuayb and those who have believ with you from our citi or you must return to our religion he said even if we were unwil
  7| 89| we would have invent against allah a lie if we return to your religion after allah had save us from it and it is not for us to return to it except that allah our lord should will our lord ha encompass all thing in knowledg upon allah we have reli our lord decid between us and our peopl in truth and you are the best of those who give decis
  7| 90| said the emin one who disbeliev among hi peopl if you should follow shuayb inde you would then be loser
  7| 91| so the earthquak seiz them and they becam within their home corps fallen prone
  7| 92| those who deni shuayb it wa as though they had never resid there those who deni shuayb it wa they who were the loser
  7| 93| and he turn away from them and said o my peopl i had certainli convey to you the messag of my lord and advis you so how could i griev for a disbeliev peopl
  7| 94| and we sent to no citi a prophet who wa deni except that we seiz it peopl with poverti and hardship that they might humbl themselv to allah
  7| 95| then we exchang in place of the bad condit good until they increas and prosper and said our father also were touch with hardship and eas so we seiz them suddenli while they did not perceiv
  7| 96| and if onli the peopl of the citi had believ and fear allah we would have open upon them bless from the heaven and the earth but they deni the messeng so we seiz them for what they were earn
  7| 97| then did the peopl of the citi feel secur from our punish come to them at night while they were asleep
  7| 98| or did the peopl of the citi feel secur from our punish come to them in the morn while they were at play
  7| 99| then did they feel secur from the plan of allah but no one feel secur from the plan of allah except the lose peopl
  7|100| ha it not becom clear to those who inherit the earth after it previou peopl that if we will we could afflict them for their sin but we seal over their heart so they do not hear
  7|101| those citi we relat to you o muhammad some of their news and certainli did their messeng come to them with clear proof but they were not to believ in that which they had deni befor thu doe allah seal over the heart of the disbeliev
  7|102| and we did not find for most of them ani coven but inde we found most of them defiantli disobedi
  7|103| then we sent after them mose with our sign to pharaoh and hi establish but they were unjust toward them so see how wa the end of the corrupt
  7|104| and mose said o pharaoh i am a messeng from the lord of the world
  7|105| who is oblig not to say about allah except the truth i have come to you with clear evid from your lord so send with me the children of israel
  7|106| pharaoh said if you have come with a sign then bring it forth if you should be of the truth
  7|107| so mose threw hi staff and suddenli it wa a serpent manifest
  7|108| and he drew out hi hand thereupon it wa white with radianc for the observ
  7|109| said the emin among the peopl of pharaoh inde thi is a learn magician
  7|110| who want to expel you from your land through magic so what do you instruct
  7|111| they said postpon the matter of him and hi brother and send among the citi gather
  7|112| who will bring you everi learn magician
  7|113| and the magician came to pharaoh they said inde for us is a reward if we are the predomin
  7|114| he said ye and moreov you will be among those made near to me
  7|115| they said o mose either you throw your staff or we will be the one to throw first
  7|116| he said throw and when they threw they bewitch the eye of the peopl and struck terror into them and they present a great feat of magic
  7|117| and we inspir to mose throw your staff and at onc it devour what they were falsifi
  7|118| so the truth wa establish and abolish wa what they were do
  7|119| and pharaoh and hi peopl were overcom right there and becam debas
  7|120| and the magician fell down in prostrat to allah
  7|121| they said we have believ in the lord of the world
  7|122| the lord of mose and aaron
  7|123| said pharaoh you believ in him befor i gave you permiss inde thi is a conspiraci which you conspir in the citi to expel therefrom it peopl but you are go to know
  7|124| i will sure cut off your hand and your feet on opposit side then i will sure crucifi you all
  7|125| they said inde to our lord we will return
  7|126| and you do not resent us except becaus we believ in the sign of our lord when they came to us our lord pour upon us patienc and let us die as muslim in submiss to you
  7|127| and the emin among the peopl of pharaoh said will you leav mose and hi peopl to caus corrupt in the land and abandon you and your god pharaoh said we will kill their son and keep their women aliv and inde we are subjug over them
  7|128| said mose to hi peopl seek help through allah and be patient inde the earth belong to allah he caus to inherit it whom he will of hi servant and the best outcom is for the righteou
  7|129| they said we have been harm befor you came to us and after you have come to us he said perhap your lord will destroy your enemi and grant you success in the land and see how you will do
  7|130| and we certainli seiz the peopl of pharaoh with year of famin and a defici in fruit that perhap they would be remind
  7|131| but when good came to them they said thi is our by right and if a bad condit struck them they saw an evil omen in mose and those with him unquestion their fortun is with allah but most of them do not know
  7|132| and they said no matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us we will not be believ in you
  7|133| so we sent upon them the flood and locust and lice and frog and blood as distinct sign but they were arrog and were a crimin peopl
  7|134| and when the punish descend upon them they said o mose invok for us your lord by what he ha promis you if you can remov the punish from us we will sure believ you and we will send with you the children of israel
  7|135| but when we remov the punish from them until a term which they were to reach then at onc they broke their word
  7|136| so we took retribut from them and we drown them in the sea becaus they deni our sign and were heedless of them
  7|137| and we caus the peopl who had been oppress to inherit the eastern region of the land and the western one which we had bless and the good word of your lord wa fulfil for the children of israel becaus of what they had patient endur and we destroy all that pharaoh and hi peopl were produc and what they had been build
  7|138| and we took the children of israel across the sea then they came upon a peopl intent in devot to some idol of their they said o mose make for us a god just as they have god he said inde you are a peopl behav ignorantli
  7|139| inde those worshipp destroy is that in which they are engag and worthless is whatev they were do
  7|140| he said is it other than allah i should desir for you as a god while he ha prefer you over the world
  7|141| and recal o children of israel when we save you from the peopl of pharaoh who were afflict you with the worst torment kill your son and keep your women aliv and in that wa a great trial from your lord
  7|142| and we made an appoint with mose for thirti night and perfect them by the addit of ten so the term of hi lord wa complet as forti night and mose said to hi brother aaron take my place among my peopl do right by them and do not follow the way of the corrupt
  7|143| and when mose arriv at our appoint time and hi lord spoke to him he said my lord show me yourself that i may look at you allah said you will not see me but look at the mountain if it should remain in place then you will see me but when hi lord appear to the mountain he render it level and mose fell unconsci and when he awok he said exalt are you i have repent to you and i am the first of the believ
  7|144| allah said o mose i have chosen you over the peopl with my messag and my word to you so take what i have given you and be among the grate
  7|145| and we wrote for him on the tablet someth of all thing instruct and explan for all thing say take them with determin and order your peopl to take the best of it i will show you the home of the defiantli disobedi
  7|146| i will turn away from my sign those who are arrog upon the earth without right and if they should see everi sign they will not believ in it and if they see the way of conscious they will not adopt it as a way but if they see the way of error they will adopt it as a way that is becaus they have deni our sign and they were heedless of them
  7|147| those who deni our sign and the meet of the hereaft their deed have becom worthless are they recompens except for what they use to do
  7|148| and the peopl of mose made after hi departur from their ornament a calf an imag have a low sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guid them to a way they took it for worship and they were wrongdoer
  7|149| and when regret overcam them and they saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord doe not have merci upon us and forgiv us we will sure be among the loser
  7|150| and when mose return to hi peopl angri and griev he said how wretch is that by which you have replac me after my departur were you impati over the matter of your lord and he threw down the tablet and seiz hi brother by the hair of hi head pull him toward him aaron said o son of my mother inde the peopl oppress me and were about to kill me so let not the enemi rejoic over me and do not place me among the wrongdo peopl
  7|151| mose said my lord forgiv me and my brother and admit us into your merci for you are the most merci of the merci
  7|152| inde those who took the calf for worship will obtain anger from their lord and humili in the life of thi world and thu do we recompens the inventor of falsehood
  7|153| but those who commit misde and then repent after them and believ inde your lord thereaft is forgiv and merci
  7|154| and when the anger subsid in mose he took up the tablet and in their inscript wa guidanc and merci for those who are fear of their lord
  7|155| and mose chose from hi peopl seventi men for our appoint and when the earthquak seiz them he said my lord if you had will you could have destroy them befor and me as well would you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done thi is not but your trial by which you send astray whom you will and guid whom you will you are our protector so forgiv us and have merci upon us and you are the best of forgiv
  7|156| and decre for us in thi world that which is good and also in the hereaft inde we have turn back to you allah said my punish i afflict with it whom i will but my merci encompass all thing so i will decre it especi for those who fear me and give zakah and those who believ in our vers
  7|157| those who follow the messeng the unlett prophet whom they find written in what they have of the torah and the gospel who enjoin upon them what is right and forbid them what is wrong and make law for them the good thing and prohibit for them the evil and reliev them of their burden and the shackl which were upon them so they who have believ in him honor him support him and follow the light which wa sent down with him it is those who will be the success
  7|158| say o muhammad o mankind inde i am the messeng of allah to you all from him to whom belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth there is no deiti except him he give life and caus death so believ in allah and hi messeng the unlett prophet who believ in allah and hi word and follow him that you may be guid
  7|159| and among the peopl of mose is a commun which guid by truth and by it establish justic
  7|160| and we divid them into twelv descend tribe as distinct nation and we inspir to mose when hi peopl implor him for water strike with your staff the stone and there gush forth from it twelv spring everi peopl knew it water place and we shade them with cloud and sent down upon them manna and quail say eat from the good thing with which we have provid you and they wrong us not but they were onli wrong themselv
  7|161| and mention o muhammad when it wa said to them dwell in thi citi and eat from it wherev you will and say reliev us of our burden and enter the gate bow humbl we will then forgiv you your sin we will increas the doer of good in good and reward
  7|162| but those who wrong among them chang the word to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent upon them a punish from the sky for the wrong that they were do
  7|163| and ask them about the town that wa by the sea when they transgress in the matter of the sabbath when their fish came to them openli on their sabbath day and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them thu did we give them trial becaus they were defiantli disobedi
  7|164| and when a commun among them said whi do you advis or warn a peopl whom allah is about to destroy or to punish with a sever punish they the advisor said to be absolv befor your lord and perhap they may fear him
  7|165| and when they forgot that by which they had been remind we save those who had forbidden evil and seiz those who wrong with a wretch punish becaus they were defiantli disobey
  7|166| so when they were insol about that which they had been forbidden we said to them be ape despis
  7|167| and mention when your lord declar that he would sure continu to send upon them until the day of resurrect those who would afflict them with the worst torment inde your lord is swift in penalti but inde he is forgiv and merci
  7|168| and we divid them throughout the earth into nation of them some were righteou and of them some were otherwis and we test them with good time and bad that perhap they would return to obedi
  7|169| and there follow them successor who inherit the scriptur while take the commod of thi lower life and say it will be forgiven for us and if an offer like it come to them they will again take it wa not the coven of the scriptur taken from them that they would not say about allah except the truth and they studi what wa in it and the home of the hereaft is better for those who fear allah so will you not use reason
  7|170| but those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer inde we will not allow to be lost the reward of the reform
  7|171| and mention when we rais the mountain abov them as if it wa a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them and allah said take what we have given you with determin and rememb what is in it that you might fear allah
  7|172| and mention when your lord took from the children of adam from their loin their descend and made them testifi of themselv say to them am i not your lord they said ye we have testifi thi lest you should say on the day of resurrect inde we were of thi unawar
  7|173| or lest you say it wa onli that our father associ other in worship with allah befor and we were but descend after them then would you destroy us for what the falsifi have done
  7|174| and thu do we explain in detail the vers and perhap they will return
  7|175| and recit to them o muhammad the news of him to whom we gave knowledg of our sign but he detach himself from them so satan pursu him and he becam of the deviat
  7|176| and if we had will we could have elev him therebi but he adher instead to the earth and follow hi own desir so hi exampl is like that of the dog if you chase him he pant or if you leav him he still pant that is the exampl of the peopl who deni our sign so relat the stori that perhap they will give thought
  7|177| how evil an exampl is that of the peopl who deni our sign and use to wrong themselv
  7|178| whoever allah guid he is the rightli guid and whoever he send astray it is those who are the loser
  7|179| and we have certainli creat for hell mani of the jinn and mankind they have heart with which they do not understand they have eye with which they do not see and they have ear with which they do not hear those are like livestock rather they are more astray it is they who are the heedless
  7|180| and to allah belong the best name so invok him by them and leav the compani of those who practic deviat concern hi name they will be recompens for what they have been do
  7|181| and among those we creat is a commun which guid by truth and therebi establish justic
  7|182| but those who deni our sign we will progress lead them to destruct from where they do not know
  7|183| and i will give them time inde my plan is firm
  7|184| then do they not give thought there is in their companion muhammad no mad he is not but a clear warner
  7|185| do they not look into the realm of the heaven and the earth and everyth that allah ha creat and think that perhap their appoint time ha come near so in what statement hereaft will they believ
  7|186| whoever allah send astray there is no guid for him and he leav them in their transgress wander blindli
  7|187| they ask you o muhammad about the hour when is it arriv say it knowledg is onli with my lord none will reveal it time except him it lay heavili upon the heaven and the earth it will not come upon you except unexpectedli they ask you as if you are familiar with it say it knowledg is onli with allah but most of the peopl do not know
  7|188| say i hold not for myself the power of benefit or harm except what allah ha will and if i knew the unseen i could have acquir much wealth and no harm would have touch me i am not except a warner and a bringer of good tide to a peopl who believ
  7|189| it is he who creat you from one soul and creat from it it mate that he might dwell in secur with her and when he cover her she carri a light burden and continu therein and when it becom heavi they both invok allah their lord if you should give us a good child we will sure be among the grate
  7|190| but when he give them a good child they ascrib partner to him concern that which he ha given them exalt is allah abov what they associ with him
  7|191| do they associ with him those who creat noth and they are themselv creat
  7|192| and the fals deiti are unabl to give them help nor can they help themselv
  7|193| and if you believ invit them to guidanc they will not follow you it is all the same for you whether you invit them or you are silent
  7|194| inde those you polytheist call upon besid allah are servant like you so call upon them and let them respond to you if you should be truth
  7|195| do they have feet by which they walk or do they have hand by which they strike or do they have eye by which they see or do they have ear by which they hear say o muhammad call your partner and then conspir against me and give me no respit
  7|196| inde my protector is allah who ha sent down the book and he is an alli to the righteou
  7|197| and those you call upon besid him are unabl to help you nor can they help themselv
  7|198| and if you invit them to guidanc they do not hear and you see them look at you while they do not see
  7|199| take what is given freeli enjoin what is good and turn away from the ignor
  7|200| and if an evil suggest come to you from satan then seek refug in allah inde he is hear and know
  7|201| inde those who fear allah when an impuls touch them from satan they rememb him and at onc they have insight
  7|202| but their brother the devil increas them in error then they do not stop short
  7|203| and when you o muhammad do not bring them a sign they say whi have you not contriv it say i onli follow what is reveal to me from my lord thi quran is enlighten from your lord and guidanc and merci for a peopl who believ
  7|204| so when the quran is recit then listen to it and pay attent that you may receiv merci
  7|205| and rememb your lord within yourself in humil and in fear without be appar in speech in the morn and the even and do not be among the heedless
  7|206| inde those who are near your lord are not prevent by arrog from hi worship and they exalt him and to him they prostrat
  8|  1| they ask you o muhammad about the bounti of war say the decis concern bounti is for allah and the messeng so fear allah and amend that which is between you and obey allah and hi messeng if you should be believ
  8|  2| the believ are onli those who when allah is mention their heart becom fear and when hi vers are recit to them it increas them in faith and upon their lord they reli
  8|  3| the one who establish prayer and from what we have provid them they spend
  8|  4| those are the believ truli for them are degre of high posit with their lord and forgiv and nobl provis
  8|  5| it is just as when your lord brought you out of your home for the battl of badr in truth while inde a parti among the believ were unwil
  8|  6| argu with you concern the truth after it had becom clear as if they were be driven toward death while they were look on
  8|  7| rememb o believ when allah promis you one of the two group that it would be your and you wish that the unarm one would be your but allah intend to establish the truth by hi word and to elimin the disbeliev
  8|  8| that he should establish the truth and abolish falsehood even if the crimin dislik it
  8|  9| rememb when you ask help of your lord and he answer you inde i will reinforc you with a thousand from the angel follow one anoth
  8| 10| and allah made it not but good tide and so that your heart would be assur therebi and victori is not but from allah inde allah is exalt in might and wise
  8| 11| rememb when he overwhelm you with drowsi give secur from him and sent down upon you from the sky rain by which to purifi you and remov from you the evil suggest of satan and to make steadfast your heart and plant firmli therebi your feet
  8| 12| rememb when your lord inspir to the angel i am with you so strengthen those who have believ i will cast terror into the heart of those who disbeliev so strike them upon the neck and strike from them everi fingertip
  8| 13| that is becaus they oppos allah and hi messeng and whoever oppos allah and hi messeng inde allah is sever in penalti
  8| 14| that is your so tast it and inde for the disbeliev is the punish of the fire
  8| 15| o you who have believ when you meet those who disbeliev advanc for battl do not turn to them your back in flight
  8| 16| and whoever turn hi back to them on such a day unless swerv as a strategi for war or join anoth compani ha certainli return with anger upon him from allah and hi refug is hell and wretch is the destin
  8| 17| and you did not kill them but it wa allah who kill them and you threw not o muhammad when you threw but it wa allah who threw that he might test the believ with a good test inde allah is hear and know
  8| 18| that is so and also that allah will weaken the plot of the disbeliev
  8| 19| if you disbeliev seek the victori the defeat ha come to you and if you desist from hostil it is best for you but if you return to war we will return and never will you be avail by your larg compani at all even if it should increas and that is becaus allah is with the believ
  8| 20| o you who have believ obey allah and hi messeng and do not turn from him while you hear hi order
  8| 21| and do not be like those who say we have heard while they do not hear
  8| 22| inde the worst of live creatur in the sight of allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason
  8| 23| had allah known ani good in them he would have made them hear and if he had made them hear they would still have turn away while they were refus
  8| 24| o you who have believ respond to allah and to the messeng when he call you to that which give you life and know that allah interven between a man and hi heart and that to him you will be gather
  8| 25| and fear a trial which will not strike those who have wrong among you exclus and know that allah is sever in penalti
  8| 26| and rememb when you were few and oppress in the land fear that peopl might abduct you but he shelter you support you with hi victori and provid you with good thing that you might be grate
  8| 27| o you who have believ do not betray allah and the messeng or betray your trust while you know the consequ
  8| 28| and know that your properti and your children are but a trial and that allah ha with him a great reward
  8| 29| o you who have believ if you fear allah he will grant you a criterion and will remov from you your misde and forgiv you and allah is the possessor of great bounti
  8| 30| and rememb o muhammad when those who disbeliev plot against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you from makkah but they plan and allah plan and allah is the best of planner
  8| 31| and when our vers are recit to them they say we have heard if we will we could say someth like thi thi is not but legend of the former peopl
  8| 32| and rememb when they said o allah if thi should be the truth from you then rain down upon us stone from the sky or bring us a pain punish
  8| 33| but allah would not punish them while you o muhammad are among them and allah would not punish them while they seek forgiv
  8| 34| but whi should allah not punish them while they obstruct peopl from almasjid al haram and they were not fit to be it guardian it true guardian are not but the righteou but most of them do not know
  8| 35| and their prayer at the hous wa not except whistl and handclap so tast the punish for what you disbeliev
  8| 36| inde those who disbeliev spend their wealth to avert peopl from the way of allah so they will spend it then it will be for them a sourc of regret then they will be overcom and those who have disbeliev unto hell they will be gather
  8| 37| thi is so that allah may distinguish the wick from the good and place the wick some of them upon other and heap them all togeth and put them into hell it is those who are the loser
  8| 38| say to those who have disbeliev that if they ceas what ha previous occur will be forgiven for them but if they return to hostil then the preced of the former rebelli peopl ha alreadi taken place
  8| 39| and fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion all of it is for allah and if they ceas then inde allah is see of what they do
  8| 40| but if they turn away then know that allah is your protector excel is the protector and excel is the helper
  8| 41| and know that anyth you obtain of war booti then inde for allah is one fifth of it and for the messeng and for hi near rel and the orphan the needi and the strand travel if you have believ in allah and in that which we sent down to our servant on the day of criterion the day when the two armi met and allah over all thing is compet
  8| 42| rememb when you were on the near side of the valley and they were on the farther side and the caravan wa lower in posit than you if you had made an appoint to meet you would have miss the appoint but it wa so that allah might accomplish a matter alreadi destin that those who perish through disbelief would perish upon evid and those who live in faith would live upon evid and inde allah is hear and know
  8| 43| rememb o muhammad when allah show them to you in your dream as few and if he had shown them to you as mani you believ would have lost courag and would have disput in the matter of whether to fight but allah save you from that inde he is know of that within the breast
  8| 44| and rememb when he show them to you when you met as few in your eye and he made you appear as few in their eye so that allah might accomplish a matter alreadi destin and to allah are all matter return
  8| 45| o you who have believ when you encount a compani from the enemi forc stand firm and rememb allah much that you may be success
  8| 46| and obey allah and hi messeng and do not disput and thu lose courag and then your strength would depart and be patient inde allah is with the patient
  8| 47| and do not be like those who came forth from their home insol and to be seen by peopl and avert them from the way of allah and allah is encompass of what they do
  8| 48| and rememb when satan made their deed pleas to them and said no one can overcom you today from among the peopl and inde i am your protector but when the two armi sight each other he turn on hi heel and said inde i am disassoci from you inde i see what you do not see inde i fear allah and allah is sever in penalti
  8| 49| rememb when the hypocrit and those in whose heart wa diseas said their religion ha delud those muslim but whoever reli upon allah then inde allah is exalt in might and wise
  8| 50| and if you could but see when the angel take the soul of those who disbeliev they are strike their face and their back and say tast the punish of the burn fire
  8| 51| that is for what your hand have put forth of evil and becaus allah is not ever unjust to hi servant
  8| 52| their is like the custom of the peopl of pharaoh and of those befor them they disbeliev in the sign of allah so allah seiz them for their sin inde allah is power and sever in penalti
  8| 53| that is becaus allah would not chang a favor which he had bestow upon a peopl until they chang what is within themselv and inde allah is hear and know
  8| 54| their is like the custom of the peopl of pharaoh and of those befor them they deni the sign of their lord so we destroy them for their sin and we drown the peopl of pharaoh and all of them were wrongdoer
  8| 55| inde the worst of live creatur in the sight of allah are those who have disbeliev and they will not ever believ
  8| 56| the one with whom you made a treati but then they break their pledg everi time and they do not fear allah

  9|108| do not stand for prayer within it ever a mosqu found on righteous from the first day is more worthi for you to stand in within it are men who love to purifi themselv and allah love those who purifi themselv
  9|109| then is one who laid the foundat of hi build on righteous with fear from allah and seek hi approv better or one who laid the foundat of hi build on the edg of a bank about to collaps so it collaps with him into the fire of hell and allah doe not guid the wrongdo peopl
  9|110| their build which they built will not ceas to be a caus of skeptic in their heart until their heart are stop and allah is know and wise
  9|111| inde allah ha purchas from the believ their live and their properti in exchang for that they will have paradis they fight in the caus of allah so they kill and are kill it is a true promis bind upon him in the torah and the gospel and the quran and who is truer to hi coven than allah so rejoic in your transact which you have contract and it is that which is the great attain

  9|117| allah ha alreadi forgiven the prophet and the muhajireen and the ansar who follow him in the hour of difficulti after the heart of a parti of them had almost inclin to doubt and then he forgav them inde he wa to them kind and merci
  9|118| and he also forgav the three who were left behind and regret their error to the point that the earth close in on them in spite of it vast and their soul confin them and they were certain that there is no refug from allah except in him then he turn to them so they could repent inde allah is the accept of repent the merci
  9|119| o you who have believ fear allah and be with those who are true
  9|120| it wa not proper for the peopl of madinah and those surround them of the bedouin that they remain behind after the departur of the messeng of allah or that they prefer themselv over hi self that is becaus they are not afflict by thirst or fatigu or hunger in the caus of allah nor do they tread on ani ground that enrag the disbeliev nor do they inflict upon an enemi ani inflict but that is regist for them as a righteou deed inde allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of the doer of good
  9|121| nor do they spend an expenditur small or larg or cross a valley but that it is regist for them that allah may reward them for the best of what they were do
  9|122| and it is not for the believ to go forth to battl all at onc for there should separ from everi divis of them a group remain to obtain understand in the religion and warn their peopl when they return to them that they might be cautiou
  9|123| o you who have believ fight those adjac to you of the disbeliev and let them find in you harsh and know that allah is with the righteou
  9|124| and whenev a surah is reveal there are among the hypocrit those who say which of you ha thi increas faith as for those who believ it ha increas them in faith while they are rejoic
  9|125| but as for those in whose heart is diseas it ha onli increas them in evil in addit to their evil and they will have die while they are disbeliev
  9|126| do they not see that they are tri everi year onc or twice but then they do not repent nor do they rememb
  9|127| and whenev a surah is reveal they look at each other say doe anyon see you and then they dismiss themselv allah ha dismiss their heart becaus they are a peopl who do not understand
  9|128| there ha certainli come to you a messeng from among yourselv grievou to him is what you suffer he is concern over you and to the believ is kind and merci
  9|129| but if they turn away o muhammad say suffici for me is allah there is no deiti except him on him i have reli and he is the lord of the great throne

 10|  2| have the peopl been amaz that we reveal revel to a man from among them say warn mankind and give good tide to those who believ that they will have a firm preced of honor with their lord but the disbeliev say inde thi is an obviou magician
 10|  3| inde your lord is allah who creat the heaven and the earth in six day and then establish himself abov the throne arrang the matter of hi creation there is no intercessor except after hi permiss that is allah your lord so worship him then will you not rememb
 10|  4| to him is your return all togeth it is the promis of allah which is truth inde he begin the process of creation and then repeat it that he may reward those who have believ and done righteou deed in justic but those who disbeliev will have a drink of scald water and a pain punish for what they use to deni
 10|  5| it is he who made the sun a shine light and the moon a deriv light and determin for it phase that you may know the number of year and account of time allah ha not creat thi except in truth he detail the sign for a peopl who know
 10|  6| inde in the altern of the night and the day and in what allah ha creat in the heaven and the earth are sign for a peopl who fear allah
 10|  7| inde those who do not expect the meet with us and are satisfi with the life of thi world and feel secur therein and those who are heedless of our sign
 10|  8| for those their refug will be the fire becaus of what they use to earn
 10|  9| inde those who have believ and done righteou deed their lord will guid them becaus of their faith beneath them river will flow in the garden of pleasur
 10| 10| their call therein will be exalt are you o allah and their greet therein will be peac and the last of their call will be prais to allah lord of the world
 10| 11| and if allah wa to hasten for the peopl the evil they invok as he hasten for them the good their term would have been end for them but we leav the one who do not expect the meet with us in their transgress wander blindli
 10| 12| and when afflict touch man he call upon us whether lie on hi side or sit or stand but when we remov from him hi afflict he continu in disobedi as if he had never call upon us to remov an afflict that touch him thu is made pleas to the transgressor that which they have been do
 10| 13| and we had alreadi destroy gener befor you when they wrong and their messeng had come to them with clear proof but they were not to believ thu do we recompens the crimin peopl
 10| 14| then we made you successor in the land after them so that we may observ how you will do
 10| 15| and when our vers are recit to them as clear evid those who do not expect the meet with us say bring us a quran other than thi or chang it say o muhammad it is not for me to chang it on my own accord i onli follow what is reveal to me inde i fear if i should disobey my lord the punish of a tremend day
 10| 16| say if allah had will i would not have recit it to you nor would he have made it known to you for i had remain among you a lifetim befor it then will you not reason
 10| 17| so who is more unjust than he who invent a lie about allah or deni hi sign inde the crimin will not succeed
 10| 18| and they worship other than allah that which neither harm them nor benefit them and they say these are our intercessor with allah say do you inform allah of someth he doe not know in the heaven or on the earth exalt is he and high abov what they associ with him
 10| 19| and mankind wa not but one commun unit in religion but then they differ and if not for a word that preced from your lord it would have been judg between them immedi concern that over which they differ
 10| 20| and they say whi is a sign not sent down to him from hi lord so say the unseen is onli for allah to administ so wait inde i am with you among those who wait
 10| 21| and when we give the peopl a tast of merci after advers ha touch them at onc they conspir against our vers say allah is swifter in strategi inde our messeng record that which you conspir
 10| 22| it is he who enabl you to travel on land and sea until when you are in ship and they sail with them by a good wind and they rejoic therein there come a storm wind and the wave come upon them from everywher and they assum that they are surround supplic allah sincer to him in religion if you should save us from thi we will sure be among the thank
 10| 23| but when he save them at onc they commit injustic upon the earth without right o mankind your injustic is onli against yourselv be mere the enjoy of worldli life then to us is your return and we will inform you of what you use to do
 10| 24| the exampl of thi worldli life is but like rain which we have sent down from the sky that the plant of the earth absorb those from which men and livestock eat until when the earth ha taken on it adorn and is beautifi and it peopl suppos that they have capabl over it there come to it our command by night or by day and we make it as a harvest as if it had not flourish yesterday thu do we explain in detail the sign for a peopl who give thought
 10| 25| and allah invit to the home of peac and guid whom he will to a straight path
 10| 26| for them who have done good is the best reward and extra no dark will cover their face nor humili those are companion of paradis they will abid therein etern
 10| 27| but they who have earn blame for evil do the recompens of an evil deed is it equival and humili will cover them they will have from allah no protector it will be as if their face are cover with piec of the night so dark are they those are the companion of the fire they will abid therein etern
 10| 28| and mention o muhammad the day we will gather them all togeth then we will say to those who associ other with allah remain in your place you and your partner then we will separ them and their partner will say you did not use to worship us
 10| 29| and suffici is allah as a wit between us and you that we were of your worship unawar
 10| 30| there on that day everi soul will be put to trial for what it did previous and they will be return to allah their master the truth and lost from them is whatev they use to invent
 10| 31| say who provid for you from the heaven and the earth or who control hear and sight and who bring the live out of the dead and bring the dead out of the live and who arrang everi matter they will say allah so say then will you not fear him
 10| 32| for that is allah your lord the truth and what can be beyond truth except error so how are you avert
 10| 33| thu the word of your lord ha come into effect upon those who defiantli disobey that they will not believ
 10| 34| say are there of your partner ani who begin creation and then repeat it say allah begin creation and then repeat it so how are you delud
 10| 35| say are there of your partner ani who guid to the truth say allah guid to the truth so is he who guid to the truth more worthi to be follow or he who guid not unless he is guid then what is wrong with you how do you judg
 10| 36| and most of them follow not except assumpt inde assumpt avail not against the truth at all inde allah is know of what they do
 10| 37| and it wa not possibl for thi quran to be produc by other than allah but it is a confirm of what wa befor it and a detail explan of the former scriptur about which there is no doubt from the lord of the world
 10| 38| or do they say about the prophet he invent it say then bring forth a surah like it and call upon for assist whomev you can besid allah if you should be truth
 10| 39| rather they have deni that which they encompass not in knowledg and whose interpret ha not yet come to them thu did those befor them deni then observ how wa the end of the wrongdoer
 10| 40| and of them are those who believ in it and of them are those who do not believ in it and your lord is most know of the corrupt
 10| 41| and if they deni you o muhammad then say for me are my deed and for you are your deed you are disassoci from what i do and i am disassoci from what you do
 10| 42| and among them are those who listen to you but can you caus the deaf to hear although they will not use reason
 10| 43| and among them are those who look at you but can you guid the blind although they will not attempt to see
 10| 44| inde allah doe not wrong the peopl at all but it is the peopl who are wrong themselv
 10| 45| and on the day when he will gather them it will be as if they had not remain in the world but an hour of the day and they will know each other those will have lost who deni the meet with allah and were not guid
 10| 46| and whether we show you some of what we promis them o muhammad or we take you in death to us is their return then either way allah is a wit concern what they are do
 10| 47| and for everi nation is a messeng so when their messeng come it will be judg between them in justic and they will not be wrong
 10| 48| and they say when is the fulfil of thi promis if you should be truth
 10| 49| say i possess not for myself ani harm or benefit except what allah should will for everi nation is a specifi term when their time ha come then they will not remain behind an hour nor will they preced it
 10| 50| say have you consid if hi punish should come to you by night or by day for which aspect of it would the crimin be impati
 10| 51| then is it that when it ha actual occur you will believ in it now and you were onc for it impati

 10| 53| and they ask inform of you o muhammad is it true say ye by my lord inde it is truth and you will not caus failur to allah
 10| 54| and if each soul that wrong had everyth on earth it would offer it in ransom and they will confid regret when they see the punish and they will be judg in justic and they will not be wrong
 10| 55| unquestion to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and the earth unquestion the promis of allah is truth but most of them do not know

 10| 59| say have you seen what allah ha sent down to you of provis of which you have made some law and some unlaw say ha allah permit you to do so or do you invent someth about allah
 10| 60| and what will be the supposit of those who invent falsehood about allah on the day of resurrect inde allah is full of bounti to the peopl but most of them are not grate
 10| 61| and o muhammad you are not engag in ani matter or recit ani of the quran and you peopl do not do ani deed except that we are wit over you when you are involv in it and not absent from your lord is ani part of an atom weight within the earth or within the heaven or anyth smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear regist
 10| 62| unquestion for the alli of allah there will be no fear concern them nor will they griev
 10| 63| those who believ and were fear allah
 10| 64| for them are good tide in the worldli life and in the hereaft no chang is there in the word of allah that is what is the great attain
 10| 65| and let not their speech griev you inde honor due to power belong to allah entir he is the hear the know
 10| 66| unquestion to allah belong whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth and those who invok other than allah do not actual follow hi partner they follow not except assumpt and they are not but falsifi
 10| 67| it is he who made for you the night to rest therein and the day give sight inde in that are sign for a peopl who listen

 10| 69| say inde those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed
 10| 70| for them is brief enjoy in thi world then to us is their return then we will make them tast the sever punish becaus they use to disbeliev
 10| 71| and recit to them the news of noah when he said to hi peopl o my peopl if my resid and my remind of the sign of allah ha becom burdensom upon you then i have reli upon allah so resolv upon your plan and call upon your associ then let not your plan be obscur to you then carri it out upon me and do not give me respit
 10| 72| and if you turn away from my advic then no payment have i ask of you my reward is onli from allah and i have been command to be of the muslim
 10| 73| and they deni him so we save him and those with him in the ship and made them successor and we drown those who deni our sign then see how wa the end of those who were warn
 10| 74| then we sent after him messeng to their peopl and they came to them with clear proof but they were not to believ in that which they had deni befor thu we seal over the heart of the transgressor
 10| 75| then we sent after them mose and aaron to pharaoh and hi establish with our sign but they behav arrogantli and were a crimin peopl
 10| 76| so when there came to them the truth from us they said inde thi is obviou magic
 10| 77| mose said do you say thu about the truth when it ha come to you is thi magic but magician will not succeed
 10| 78| they said have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our father and so that you two may have grandeur in the land and we are not believ in you
 10| 79| and pharaoh said bring to me everi learn magician
 10| 80| so when the magician came mose said to them throw down whatev you will throw
 10| 81| and when they had thrown mose said what you have brought is onli magic inde allah will expos it worthless inde allah doe not amend the work of corrupt
 10| 82| and allah will establish the truth by hi word even if the crimin dislik it
 10| 83| but no one believ mose except some youth among hi peopl for fear of pharaoh and hi establish that they would persecut them and inde pharaoh wa haughti within the land and inde he wa of the transgressor
 10| 84| and mose said o my peopl if you have believ in allah then reli upon him if you should be muslim
 10| 85| so they said upon allah do we reli our lord make us not object of trial for the wrongdo peopl
 10| 86| and save us by your merci from the disbeliev peopl
 10| 87| and we inspir to mose and hi brother settl your peopl in egypt in hous and make your hous face the qiblah and establish prayer and give good tide to the believ
 10| 88| and mose said our lord inde you have given pharaoh and hi establish splendor and wealth in the worldli life our lord that they may lead men astray from your way our lord obliter their wealth and harden their heart so that they will not believ until they see the pain punish
 10| 89| allah said your supplic ha been answer so remain on a right cours and follow not the way of those who do not know
 10| 90| and we took the children of israel across the sea and pharaoh and hi soldier pursu them in tyranni and enmiti until when drown overtook him he said i believ that there is no deiti except that in whom the children of israel believ and i am of the muslim
 10| 91| now and you had disobey him befor and were of the corrupt
 10| 92| so today we will save you in bodi that you may be to those who succeed you a sign and inde mani among the peopl of our sign are heedless
 10| 93| and we had certainti settl the children of israel in an agreeabl settlement and provid them with good thing and they did not differ until after knowledg had come to them inde your lord will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ
 10| 94| so if you are in doubt o muhammad about that which we have reveal to you then ask those who have been read the scriptur befor you the truth ha certainli come to you from your lord so never be among the doubter
 10| 95| and never be of those who deni the sign of allah and thu be among the loser
 10| 96| inde those upon whom the word of your lord ha come into effect will not believ
 10| 97| even if everi sign should come to them until they see the pain punish
 10| 98| then ha there not been a singl citi that believ so it faith benefit it except the peopl of jonah when they believ we remov from them the punish of disgrac in worldli life and gave them enjoy for a time
 10| 99| and had your lord will those on earth would have believ all of them entir then o muhammad would you compel the peopl in order that they becom believ
 10|100| and it is not for a soul to believ except by permiss of allah and he will place defil upon those who will not use reason
 10|101| say observ what is in the heaven and earth but of no avail will be sign or warner to a peopl who do not believ
 10|102| so do they wait except for like what occur in the day of those who pass on befor them say then wait inde i am with you among those who wait
 10|103| then we will save our messeng and those who have believ thu it is an oblig upon us that we save the believ
 10|104| say o muhammad o peopl if you are in doubt as to my religion then i do not worship those which you worship besid allah but i worship allah who caus your death and i have been command to be of the believ
 10|105| and command direct your face toward the religion inclin to truth and never be of those who associ other with allah
 10|106| and do not invok besid allah that which neither benefit you nor harm you for if you did then inde you would be of the wrongdoer
 10|107| and if allah should touch you with advers there is no remov of it except him and if he intend for you good then there is no repel of hi bounti he caus it to reach whom he will of hi servant and he is the forgiv the merci
 10|108| say o mankind the truth ha come to you from your lord so whoever is guid is onli guid for the benefit of hi soul and whoever goe astray onli goe astray in violat against it and i am not over you a manag
 10|109| and follow what is reveal to you o muhammad and be patient until allah will judg and he is the best of judg
 11|  1| alif lam ra thi is a book whose vers are perfect and then present in detail from one who is wise and acquaint
 11|  2| through a messeng say do not worship except allah inde i am to you from him a warner and a bringer of good tide
 11|  3| and say seek forgiv of your lord and repent to him and he will let you enjoy a good provis for a specifi term and give everi doer of favor hi favor but if you turn away then inde i fear for you the punish of a great day
 11|  4| to allah is your return and he is over all thing compet
 11|  5| unquestion they the disbeliev turn away their breast to hide themselv from him unquestion even when they cover themselv in their cloth allah know what they conceal and what they declar inde he is know of that within the breast
 11|  6| and there is no creatur on earth but that upon allah is it provis and he know it place of dwell and place of storag all is in a clear regist
 11|  7| and it is he who creat the heaven and the earth in six day and hi throne had been upon water that he might test you as to which of you is best in deed but if you say inde you are resurrect after death those who disbeliev will sure say thi is not but obviou magic
 11|  8| and if we hold back from them the punish for a limit time they will sure say what detain it unquestion on the day it come to them it will not be avert from them and they will be envelop by what they use to ridicul
 11|  9| and if we give man a tast of merci from us and then we withdraw it from him inde he is despair and ungrat
 11| 10| but if we give him a tast of favor after hardship ha touch him he will sure say bad time have left me inde he is exult and boast
 11| 11| except for those who are patient and do righteou deed those will have forgiv and great reward
 11| 12| then would you possibl leav out some of what is reveal to you or is your breast constrain by it becaus they say whi ha there not been sent down to him a treasur or come with him an angel but you are onli a warner and allah is dispos of all thing
 11| 13| or do they say he invent it say then bring ten surah like it that have been invent and call upon for assist whomev you can besid allah if you should be truth
 11| 14| and if they do not respond to you then know that the quran wa reveal with the knowledg of allah and that there is no deiti except him then would you not be muslim
 11| 15| whoever desir the life of thi world and it adorn we fulli repay them for their deed therein and they therein will not be depriv
 11| 16| those are the one for whom there is not in the hereaft but the fire and lost is what they did therein and worthless is what they use to do
 11| 17| so is one who stand upon a clear evid from hi lord like the aforement and a wit from him follow it and befor it wa the scriptur of mose to lead and as merci those believ in the former revel believ in the quran but whoever disbeliev in it from the variou faction the fire is hi promis destin so be not in doubt about it inde it is the truth from your lord but most of the peopl do not believ
 11| 18| and who is more unjust than he who invent a lie about allah those will be present befor their lord and the wit will say these are the one who lie against their lord unquestion the curs of allah is upon the wrongdoer
 11| 19| who avert peopl from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they concern the hereaft were disbeliev
 11| 20| those were not caus failur to allah on earth nor did they have besid allah ani protector for them the punish will be multipli they were not abl to hear nor did they see
 11| 21| those are the one who will have lost themselv and lost from them is what they use to invent
 11| 22| assuredli it is they in the hereaft who will be the greatest loser
 11| 23| inde they who have believ and done righteou deed and humbl themselv to their lord those are the companion of paradis they will abid etern therein
 11| 24| the exampl of the two parti is like the blind and deaf and the see and hear are they equal in comparison then will you not rememb
 11| 25| and we had certainli sent noah to hi peopl say inde i am to you a clear warner
 11| 26| that you not worship except allah inde i fear for you the punish of a pain day
 11| 27| so the emin among those who disbeliev from hi peopl said we do not see you but as a man like ourselv and we do not see you follow except by those who are the lowest of us and at first suggest and we do not see in you over us ani merit rather we think you are liar
 11| 28| he said o my peopl have you consid if i should be upon clear evid from my lord while he ha given me merci from himself but it ha been made unappar to you should we forc it upon you while you are avers to it
 11| 29| and o my peopl i ask not of you for it ani wealth my reward is not but from allah and i am not one to drive away those who have believ inde they will meet their lord but i see that you are a peopl behav ignorantli
 11| 30| and o my peopl who would protect me from allah if i drove them away then will you not be remind
 11| 31| and i do not tell you that i have the depositori contain the provis of allah or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel nor do i say of those upon whom your eye look down that allah will never grant them ani good allah is most know of what is within their soul inde i would then be among the wrongdoer
 11| 32| they said o noah you have disput us and been frequent in disput of us so bring us what you threaten us if you should be of the truth
 11| 33| he said allah will onli bring it to you if he will and you will not caus him failur
 11| 34| and my advic will not benefit you although i wish to advis you if allah should intend to put you in error he is your lord and to him you will be return
 11| 35| or do they say about prophet muhammad he invent it say if i have invent it then upon me is the consequ of my crime but i am innoc of what crime you commit
 11| 36| and it wa reveal to noah that no one will believ from your peopl except those who have alreadi believ so do not be distress by what they have been do
 11| 37| and construct the ship under our observ and our inspir and do not address me concern those who have wrong inde they are to be drown
 11| 38| and he construct the ship and whenev an assembl of the emin of hi peopl pass by him they ridicul him he said if you ridicul us then we will ridicul you just as you ridicul
 11| 39| and you are go to know who will get a punish that will disgrac him on earth and upon whom will descend an endur punish in the hereaft
 11| 40| so it wa until when our command came and the oven overflow we said load upon the ship of each creatur two mate and your famili except those about whom the word ha preced and includ whoever ha believ but none had believ with him except a few
 11| 41| and noah said embark therein in the name of allah is it cours and it anchorag inde my lord is forgiv and merci
 11| 42| and it sail with them through wave like mountain and noah call to hi son who wa apart from them o my son come aboard with us and be not with the disbeliev
 11| 43| but he said i will take refug on a mountain to protect me from the water noah said there is no protector today from the decre of allah except for whom he give merci and the wave came between them and he wa among the drown
 11| 44| and it wa said o earth swallow your water and o sky withhold your rain and the water subsid and the matter wa accomplish and the ship came to rest on the mountain of judiyi and it wa said away with the wrongdo peopl
 11| 45| and noah call to hi lord and said my lord inde my son is of my famili and inde your promis is true and you are the most just of judg
 11| 46| he said o noah inde he is not of your famili inde he is one whose work wa other than righteou so ask me not for that about which you have no knowledg inde i advis you lest you be among the ignor
 11| 47| noah said my lord i seek refug in you from ask that of which i have no knowledg and unless you forgiv me and have merci upon me i will be among the loser
 11| 48| it wa said o noah disembark in secur from us and bless upon you and upon nation descend from those with you but other nation of them we will grant enjoy then there will touch them from us a pain punish
 11| 49| that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad you knew it not neither you nor your peopl befor thi so be patient inde the best outcom is for the righteou
 11| 50| and to aad we sent their brother hud he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him you are not but inventor of falsehood
 11| 51| o my peopl i do not ask you for it ani reward my reward is onli from the one who creat me then will you not reason
 11| 52| and o my peopl ask forgiv of your lord and then repent to him he will send rain from the sky upon you in shower and increas you in strength ad to your strength and do not turn away be crimin
 11| 53| they said o hud you have not brought us clear evid and we are not one to leav our god on your sayso nor are we believ in you
 11| 54| we onli say that some of our god have possess you with evil he said inde i call allah to wit and wit yourselv that i am free from whatev you associ with allah
 11| 55| other than him so plot against me all togeth then do not give me respit
 11| 56| inde i have reli upon allah my lord and your lord there is no creatur but that he hold it forelock inde my lord is on a path that is straight
 11| 57| but if they turn away say i have alreadi convey that with which i wa sent to you my lord will give success to a peopl other than you and you will not harm him at all inde my lord is over all thing guardian
 11| 58| and when our command came we save hud and those who believ with him by merci from us and we save them from a harsh punish
 11| 59| and that wa aad who reject the sign of their lord and disobey hi messeng and follow the order of everi obstin tyrant
 11| 60| and they were therefor follow in thi world with a curs and as well on the day of resurrect unquestion aad deni their lord then away with aad the peopl of hud
 11| 61| and to thamud we sent their brother salih he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him he ha produc you from the earth and settl you in it so ask forgiv of him and then repent to him inde my lord is near and respons
 11| 62| they said o salih you were among us a man of promis befor thi do you forbid us to worship what our father worship and inde we are about that to which you invit us in disquiet doubt
 11| 63| he said o my peopl have you consid if i should be upon clear evid from my lord and he ha given me merci from himself who would protect me from allah if i disobey him so you would not increas me except in loss
 11| 64| and o my peopl thi is the shecamel of allah she is to you a sign so let her feed upon allah s earth and do not touch her with harm or you will be taken by an impend punish
 11| 65| but they hamstrung her so he said enjoy yourselv in your home for three day that is a promis not to be deni
 11| 66| so when our command came we save salih and those who believ with him by merci from us and save them from the disgrac of that day inde it is your lord who is the power the exalt in might
 11| 67| and the shriek seiz those who had wrong and they becam within their home corps fallen prone
 11| 68| as if they had never prosper therein unquestion thamud deni their lord then away with thamud
 11| 69| and certainli did our messeng come to abraham with good tide they said peac he said peac and did not delay in bring them a roast calf
 11| 70| but when he saw their hand not reach for it he distrust them and felt from them apprehens they said fear not we have been sent to the peopl of lot
 11| 71| and hi wife wa stand and she smile then we gave her good tide of isaac and after isaac jacob
 11| 72| she said woe to me shall i give birth while i am an old woman and thi my husband is an old man inde thi is an amaz thing
 11| 73| they said are you amaz at the decre of allah may the merci of allah and hi bless be upon you peopl of the hous inde he is praiseworthi and honor
 11| 74| and when the fright had left abraham and the good tide had reach him he began to argu with us concern the peopl of lot
 11| 75| inde abraham wa forbear griev and frequent return to allah
 11| 76| the angel said o abraham give up thi plea inde the command of your lord ha come and inde there will reach them a punish that can not be repel
 11| 77| and when our messeng the angel came to lot he wa anguish for them and felt for them great discomfort and said thi is a tri day
 11| 78| and hi peopl came hasten to him and befor thi they had been do evil deed he said o my peopl these are my daughter they are purer for you so fear allah and do not disgrac me concern my guest is there not among you a man of reason

 11| 82| so when our command came we made the highest part of the citi it lowest and rain upon them stone of layer hard clay which were
 11| 83| mark from your lord and allah s punish is not from the wrongdoer veri far
 11| 84| and to madyan we sent their brother shuayb he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him and do not decreas from the measur and the scale inde i see you in prosper but inde i fear for you the punish of an allencompass day
 11| 85| and o my peopl give full measur and weight in justic and do not depriv the peopl of their due and do not commit abus on the earth spread corrupt

 11| 89| and o my peopl let not your dissens from me caus you to be struck by that similar to what struck the peopl of noah or the peopl of hud or the peopl of salih and the peopl of lot are not from you far away
 11| 90| and ask forgiv of your lord and then repent to him inde my lord is merci and affection
 11| 91| they said o shuayb we do not understand much of what you say and inde we consid you among us as weak and if not for your famili we would have stone you to death and you are not to us one respect
 11| 92| he said o my peopl is my famili more respect for power by you than allah but you put him behind your back in neglect inde my lord is encompass of what you do
 11| 93| and o my peopl work accord to your posit inde i am work you are go to know to whom will come a punish that will disgrac him and who is a liar so watch inde i am with you a watcher await the outcom
 11| 94| and when our command came we save shuayb and those who believ with him by merci from us and the shriek seiz those who had wrong and they becam within their home corps fallen prone
 11| 95| as if they had never prosper therein then away with madyan as thamud wa taken away
 11| 96| and we did certainli send mose with our sign and a clear author
 11| 97| to pharaoh and hi establish but they follow the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh wa not at all discern
 11| 98| he will preced hi peopl on the day of resurrect and lead them into the fire and wretch is the place to which they are led
 11| 99| and they were follow in thi world with a curs and on the day of resurrect and wretch is the gift which is given
 11|100| that is from the news of the citi which we relat to you of them some are still stand and some are as a harvest mow down
 11|101| and we did not wrong them but they wrong themselv and they were not avail at all by their god which they invok other than allah when there came the command of your lord and they did not increas them in other than ruin
 11|102| and thu is the seizur of your lord when he seiz the citi while they are commit wrong inde hi seizur is pain and sever
 11|103| inde in that is a sign for those who fear the punish of the hereaft that is a day for which the peopl will be collect and that is a day which will be wit
 11|104| and we do not delay it except for a limit term
 11|105| the day it come no soul will speak except by hi permiss and among them will be the wretch and the prosper
 11|106| as for those who were destin to be wretch they will be in the fire for them therein is violent exhal and inhal
 11|107| they will be abid therein as long as the heaven and the earth endur except what your lord should will inde your lord is an effect of what he intend
 11|108| and as for those who were destin to be prosper they will be in paradis abid therein as long as the heaven and the earth endur except what your lord should will a bestow uninterrupt
 11|109| so do not be in doubt o muhammad as to what these polytheist are worship they worship not except as their father worship befor and inde we will give them their share undiminish
 11|110| and we had certainli given mose the scriptur but it came under disagr and if not for a word that preced from your lord it would have been judg between them and inde they are concern the quran in disquiet doubt
 11|111| and inde each of the believ and disbeliev your lord will fulli compens them for their deed inde he is acquaint with what they do
 11|112| so remain on a right cours as you have been command you and those who have turn back with you to allah and do not transgress inde he is see of what you do
 11|113| and do not inclin toward those who do wrong lest you be touch by the fire and you would not have other than allah ani protector then you would not be help
 11|114| and establish prayer at the two end of the day and at the approach of the night inde good deed do away with misde that is a remind for those who rememb
 11|115| and be patient for inde allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
 11|116| so whi were there not among the gener befor you those of endur discrimin forbid corrupt on earth except a few of those we save from among them but those who wrong pursu what luxuri they were given therein and they were crimin
 11|117| and your lord would not have destroy the citi unjustli while their peopl were reform
 11|118| and if your lord had will he could have made mankind one commun but they will not ceas to differ
 11|119| except whom your lord ha given merci and for that he creat them but the word of your lord is to be fulfil that i will sure fill hell with jinn and men all togeth

 11|123| and to allah belong the unseen aspect of the heaven and the earth and to him will be return the matter all of it so worship him and reli upon him and your lord is not unawar of that which you do
 12|  1| alif lam ra these are the vers of the clear book
 12|  2| inde we have sent it down as an arab quran that you might understand
 12|  3| we relat to you o muhammad the best of stori in what we have reveal to you of thi quran although you were befor it among the unawar
 12|  4| of these stori mention when joseph said to hi father o my father inde i have seen in a dream eleven star and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrat to me
 12|  5| he said o my son do not relat your vision to your brother or they will contriv against you a plan inde satan to man is a manifest enemi
 12|  6| and thu will your lord choos you and teach you the interpret of narr and complet hi favor upon you and upon the famili of jacob as he complet it upon your father befor abraham and isaac inde your lord is know and wise
 12|  7| certainli were there in joseph and hi brother sign for those who ask
 12|  8| when they said joseph and hi brother are more belov to our father than we while we are a clan inde our father is in clear error
 12|  9| kill joseph or cast him out to anoth land the counten of your father will then be onli for you and you will be after that a righteou peopl
 12| 10| said a speaker among them do not kill joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well some travel will pick him up if you would do someth
 12| 11| they said o our father whi do you not entrust us with joseph while inde we are to him sincer counselor
 12| 12| send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play and inde we will be hi guardian
 12| 13| jacob said inde it sadden me that you should take him and i fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unawar
 12| 14| they said if a wolf should eat him while we are a strong clan inde we would then be loser
 12| 15| so when they took him out and agre to put him into the bottom of the well but we inspir to him you will sure inform them someday about thi affair of their while they do not perceiv your ident
 12| 16| and they came to their father at night weep
 12| 17| they said o our father inde we went race each other and left joseph with our possess and a wolf ate him but you would not believ us even if we were truth
 12| 18| and they brought upon hi shirt fals blood jacob said rather your soul have entic you to someth so patienc is most fit and allah is the one sought for help against that which you describ
 12| 19| and there came a compani of travel then they sent their water drawer and he let down hi bucket he said good news here is a boy and they conceal him take him as merchandis and allah wa know of what they did
 12| 20| and they sold him for a reduc price a few dirham and they were concern him of those content with littl
 12| 21| and the one from egypt who bought him said to hi wife make hi resid comfort perhap he will benefit us or we will adopt him as a son and thu we establish joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpret of event and allah is predomin over hi affair but most of the peopl do not know
 12| 22| and when joseph reach matur we gave him judgment and knowledg and thu we reward the doer of good
 12| 23| and she in whose hous he wa sought to seduc him she close the door and said come you he said i seek the refug of allah inde he is my master who ha made good my resid inde wrongdoer will not succeed
 12| 24| and she certainli determin to seduc him and he would have inclin to her had he not seen the proof of hi lord and thu it wa that we should avert from him evil and immor inde he wa of our chosen servant
 12| 25| and they both race to the door and she tore hi shirt from the back and they found her husband at the door she said what is the recompens of one who intend evil for your wife but that he be imprison or a pain punish
 12| 26| joseph said it wa she who sought to seduc me and a wit from her famili testifi if hi shirt is torn from the front then she ha told the truth and he is of the liar
 12| 27| but if hi shirt is torn from the back then she ha lie and he is of the truth
 12| 28| so when her husband saw hi shirt torn from the back he said inde it is of the women plan inde your plan is great
 12| 29| joseph ignor thi and my wife ask forgiv for your sin inde you were of the sin
 12| 30| and women in the citi said the wife of alazeez is seek to seduc her slave boy he ha impass her with love inde we see her to be in clear error
 12| 31| so when she heard of their scheme she sent for them and prepar for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said to joseph come out befor them and when they saw him they greatli admir him and cut their hand and said perfect is allah thi is not a man thi is none but a nobl angel
 12| 32| she said that is the one about whom you blame me and i certainli sought to seduc him but he firmli refus and if he will not do what i order him he will sure be imprison and will be of those debas
 12| 33| he said my lord prison is more to my like than that to which they invit me and if you do not avert from me their plan i might inclin toward them and thu be of the ignor
 12| 34| so hi lord respond to him and avert from him their plan inde he is the hear the know
 12| 35| then it appear to them after they had seen the sign that alazeez should sure imprison him for a time
 12| 36| and there enter the prison with him two young men one of them said inde i have seen myself in a dream press wine the other said inde i have seen myself carri upon my head some bread from which the bird were eat inform us of it interpret inde we see you to be of those who do good
 12| 37| he said you will not receiv food that is provid to you except that i will inform you of it interpret befor it come to you that is from what my lord ha taught me inde i have left the religion of a peopl who do not believ in allah and they in the hereaft are disbeliev
 12| 38| and i have follow the religion of my father abraham isaac and jacob and it wa not for us to associ anyth with allah that is from the favor of allah upon us and upon the peopl but most of the peopl are not grate
 12| 39| o my two companion of prison are separ lord better or allah the one the prevail
 12| 40| you worship not besid him except mere name you have name them you and your father for which allah ha sent down no author legisl is not but for allah he ha command that you worship not except him that is the correct religion but most of the peopl do not know
 12| 41| o two companion of prison as for one of you he will give drink to hi master of wine but as for the other he will be crucifi and the bird will eat from hi head the matter ha been decre about which you both inquir
 12| 42| and he said to the one whom he knew would go free mention me befor your master but satan made him forget the mention to hi master and joseph remain in prison sever year
 12| 43| and subsequ the king said inde i have seen in a dream seven fat cow be eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spike of grain and other that were dri o emin one explain to me my vision if you should interpret vision
 12| 44| they said it is but a mixtur of fals dream and we are not learn in the interpret of dream
 12| 45| but the one who wa freed and rememb after a time said i will inform you of it interpret so send me forth
 12| 46| he said joseph o man of truth explain to us about seven fat cow eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spike of grain and other that were dri that i may return to the peopl perhap they will know about you
 12| 47| joseph said you will plant for seven year consecut and what you harvest leav in it spike except a littl from which you will eat
 12| 48| then will come after that seven difficult year which will consum what you save for them except a littl from which you will store
 12| 49| then will come after that a year in which the peopl will be given rain and in which they will press oliv and grape
 12| 50| and the king said bring him to me but when the messeng came to him joseph said return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hand inde my lord is know of their plan
 12| 51| said the king to the women what wa your condit when you sought to seduc joseph they said perfect is allah we know about him no evil the wife of alazeez said now the truth ha becom evid it wa i who sought to seduc him and inde he is of the truth
 12| 52| that is so alazeez will know that i did not betray him in hi absenc and that allah doe not guid the plan of betray
 12| 53| and i do not acquit myself inde the soul is a persist enjoin of evil except those upon which my lord ha merci inde my lord is forgiv and merci
 12| 54| and the king said bring him to me i will appoint him exclus for myself and when he spoke to him he said inde you are today establish in posit and trust
 12| 55| joseph said appoint me over the storehous of the land inde i will be a know guardian
 12| 56| and thu we establish joseph in the land to settl therein wherev he will we touch with our merci whom we will and we do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
 12| 57| and the reward of the hereaft is better for those who believ and were fear allah
 12| 58| and the brother of joseph came seek food and they enter upon him and he recogn them but he wa to them unknown
 12| 59| and when he had furnish them with their suppli he said bring me a brother of your from your father do not you see that i give full measur and that i am the best of accommod
 12| 60| but if you do not bring him to me no measur will there be hereaft for you from me nor will you approach me
 12| 61| they said we will attempt to dissuad hi father from keep him and inde we will do it
 12| 62| and joseph said to hi servant put their merchandis into their saddlebag so they might recogn it when they have gone back to their peopl that perhap they will again return
 12| 63| so when they return to their father they said o our father further measur ha been deni to us so send with us our brother that we will be given measur and inde we will be hi guardian
 12| 64| he said should i entrust you with him except under coercion as i entrust you with hi brother befor but allah is the best guardian and he is the most merci of the merci
 12| 65| and when they open their baggag they found their merchandis return to them they said o our father what more could we desir thi is our merchandis return to us and we will obtain suppli for our famili and protect our brother and obtain an increas of a camel load that is an easi measur
 12| 66| jacob said never will i send him with you until you give me a promis by allah that you will bring him back to me unless you should be surround by enemi and when they had given their promis he said allah over what we say is wit
 12| 67| and he said o my son do not enter from one gate but enter from differ gate and i can not avail you against the decre of allah at all the decis is onli for allah upon him i have reli and upon him let those who would reli inde reli
 12| 68| and when they enter from where their father had order them it did not avail them against allah at all except it wa a need within the soul of jacob which he satisfi and inde he wa a possessor of knowledg becaus of what we had taught him but most of the peopl do not know
 12| 69| and when they enter upon joseph he took hi brother to himself he said inde i am your brother so do not despair over what they use to do to me
 12| 70| so when he had furnish them with their suppli he put the gold measur bowl into the bag of hi brother then an announc call out o caravan inde you are thiev
 12| 71| they said while approach them what is it you are miss
 12| 72| they said we are miss the measur of the king and for he who produc it is the reward of a camel load and i am respons for it
 12| 73| they said by allah you have certainli known that we did not come to caus corrupt in the land and we have not been thiev
 12| 74| the accus said then what would be it recompens if you should be liar
 12| 75| the brother said it recompens is that he in whose bag it is found he himself will be it recompens thu do we recompens the wrongdoer
 12| 76| so he began the search with their bag befor the bag of hi brother then he extract it from the bag of hi brother thu did we plan for joseph he could not have taken hi brother within the religion of the king except that allah will we rais in degre whom we will but over everi possessor of knowledg is one more know
 12| 77| they said if he steal a brother of hi ha stolen befor but joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them he said you are wors in posit and allah is most know of what you describ
 12| 78| they said o azeez inde he ha a father who is an old man so take one of us in place of him inde we see you as a doer of good
 12| 79| he said i seek the refug of allah to prevent that we take except him with whom we found our possess inde we would then be unjust
 12| 80| so when they had despair of him they seclud themselv in privat consult the eldest of them said do you not know that your father ha taken upon you an oath by allah and that befor you fail in your duti to joseph so i will never leav thi land until my father permit me or allah decid for me and he is the best of judg
 12| 81| return to your father and say o our father inde your son ha stolen and we did not testifi except to what we knew and we were not wit of the unseen
 12| 82| and ask the citi in which we were and the caravan in which we came and inde we are truth
 12| 83| jacob said rather your soul have entic you to someth so patienc is most fit perhap allah will bring them to me all togeth inde it is he who is the know the wise
 12| 84| and he turn away from them and said oh my sorrow over joseph and hi eye becam white from grief for he wa of that a suppressor
 12| 85| they said by allah you will not ceas rememb joseph until you becom fatal ill or becom of those who perish
 12| 86| he said i onli complain of my suffer and my grief to allah and i know from allah that which you do not know
 12| 87| o my son go and find out about joseph and hi brother and despair not of relief from allah inde no one despair of relief from allah except the disbeliev peopl
 12| 88| so when they enter upon joseph they said o azeez advers ha touch us and our famili and we have come with good poor in qualiti but give us full measur and be charit to us inde allah reward the charit
 12| 89| he said do you know what you did with joseph and hi brother when you were ignor
 12| 90| they said are you inde joseph he said i am joseph and thi is my brother allah ha certainli favor us inde he who fear allah and is patient then inde allah doe not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
 12| 91| they said by allah certainli ha allah prefer you over us and inde we have been sinner
 12| 92| he said no blame will there be upon you today allah will forgiv you and he is the most merci of the merci
 12| 93| take thi my shirt and cast it over the face of my father he will becom see and bring me your famili all togeth
 12| 94| and when the caravan depart from egypt their father said inde i find the smell of joseph and would say that he wa aliv if you did not think me weaken in mind
 12| 95| they said by allah inde you are in your same old error
 12| 96| and when the bearer of good tide arriv he cast it over hi face and he return onc again see he said did i not tell you that i know from allah that which you do not know
 12| 97| they said o our father ask for us forgiv of our sin inde we have been sinner

 12| 99| and when they enter upon joseph he took hi parent to himself and said enter egypt allah will safe and secur
 12|100| and he rais hi parent upon the throne and they bow to him in prostrat and he said o my father thi is the explan of my vision of befor my lord ha made it realiti and he wa certainli good to me when he took me out of prison and brought you here from bedouin life after satan had induc estrang between me and my brother inde my lord is subtl in what he will inde it is he who is the know the wise
 12|101| my lord you have given me someth of sovereignti and taught me of the interpret of dream creator of the heaven and earth you are my protector in thi world and in the hereaft caus me to die a muslim and join me with the righteou
 12|102| that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal o muhammad to you and you were not with them when they put togeth their plan while they conspir
 12|103| and most of the peopl although you strive for it are not believ
 12|104| and you do not ask of them for it ani payment it is not except a remind to the world
 12|105| and how mani a sign within the heaven and earth do they pass over while they therefrom are turn away
 12|106| and most of them believ not in allah except while they associ other with him
 12|107| then do they feel secur that there will not come to them an overwhelm aspect of the punish of allah or that the hour will not come upon them suddenli while they do not perceiv
 12|108| say thi is my way i invit to allah with insight i and those who follow me and exalt is allah and i am not of those who associ other with him
 12|109| and we sent not befor you as messeng except men to whom we reveal from among the peopl of citi so have they not travel through the earth and observ how wa the end of those befor them and the home of the hereaft is best for those who fear allah then will you not reason
 12|110| they continu until when the messeng despair and were certain that they had been deni there came to them our victori and whoever we will wa save and our punish can not be repel from the peopl who are crimin
 12|111| there wa certainli in their stori a lesson for those of understand never wa the quran a narrat invent but a confirm of what wa befor it and a detail explan of all thing and guidanc and merci for a peopl who believ
 13|  1| alif lam meem ra these are the vers of the book and what ha been reveal to you from your lord is the truth but most of the peopl do not believ
 13|  2| it is allah who erect the heaven without pillar that you can see then he establish himself abov the throne and made subject the sun and the moon each run it cours for a specifi term he arrang each matter he detail the sign that you may of the meet with your lord be certain
 13|  3| and it is he who spread the earth and place therein firmli set mountain and river and from all of the fruit he made therein two mate he caus the night to cover the day inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought
 13|  4| and within the land are neighbor plot and garden of grapevin and crop and palm tree grow sever from a root or otherwis water with one water but we make some of them exceed other in qualiti of fruit inde in that are sign for a peopl who reason
 13|  5| and if you are astonish o muhammad then astonish is their say when we are dust will we inde be brought into a new creation those are the one who have disbeliev in their lord and those will have shackl upon their neck and those are the companion of the fire they will abid therein etern
 13|  6| they impati urg you to bring about evil befor good while there ha alreadi occur befor them similar punish to what they demand and inde your lord is full of forgiv for the peopl despit their wrongdo and inde your lord is sever in penalti
 13|  7| and those who disbeliev say whi ha a sign not been sent down to him from hi lord you are onli a warner and for everi peopl is a guid
 13|  8| allah know what everi femal carri and what the womb lose prematur or exceed and everyth with him is by due measur
 13|  9| he is knower of the unseen and the wit the grand the exalt
 13| 10| it is the same to him concern you whether one conceal hi speech or one public it and whether one is hidden by night or conspicu among other by day
 13| 11| for each one are success angel befor and behind him who protect him by the decre of allah inde allah will not chang the condit of a peopl until they chang what is in themselv and when allah intend for a peopl ill there is no repel it and there is not for them besid him ani patron
 13| 12| it is he who show you lighten caus fear and aspir and gener the heavi cloud
 13| 13| and the thunder exalt allah with prais of him and the angel as well from fear of him and he send thunderbolt and strike therewith whom he will while they disput about allah and he is sever in assault

 15| 81| and we gave them our sign but from them they were turn away
 15| 82| and they use to carv from the mountain hous feel secur
 15| 83| but the shriek seiz them at earli morn
 15| 84| so noth avail them from what they use to earn

 16| 15| and he ha cast into the earth firmli set mountain lest it shift with you and made river and road that you may be guid
 16| 16| and landmark and by the star they are also guid
 16| 17| then is he who creat like one who doe not creat so will you not be remind
 16| 18| and if you should count the favor of allah you could not enumer them inde allah is forgiv and merci
 16| 19| and allah know what you conceal and what you declar
 16| 20| and those they invok other than allah creat noth and they themselv are creat
 16| 21| they are in fact dead not aliv and they do not perceiv when they will be resurrect
 16| 22| your god is one god but those who do not believ in the hereaft their heart are disapprov and they are arrog
 16| 23| assuredli allah know what they conceal and what they declar inde he doe not like the arrog
 16| 24| and when it is said to them what ha your lord sent down they say legend of the former peopl
 16| 25| that they may bear their own burden in full on the day of resurrect and some of the burden of those whom they misguid without knowledg unquestion evil is that which they bear
 16| 26| those befor them had alreadi plot but allah came at their build from the foundat so the roof fell upon them from abov them and the punish came to them from where they did not perceiv
 16| 27| then on the day of resurrect he will disgrac them and say where are my partner for whom you use to oppos the believ those who were given knowledg will say inde disgrac thi day and evil are upon the disbeliev
 16| 28| the one whom the angel take in death while wrong themselv and who then offer submiss say we were not do ani evil but ye inde allah is know of what you use to do
 16| 29| so enter the gate of hell to abid etern therein and how wretch is the resid of the arrog
 16| 30| and it will be said to those who fear allah what did your lord send down they will say that which is good for those who do good in thi world is good and the home of the hereaft is better and how excel is the home of the righteou
 16| 31| garden of perpetu resid which they will enter beneath which river flow they will have therein whatev they wish thu doe allah reward the righteou
 16| 32| the one whom the angel take in death be good and pure the angel will say peac be upon you enter paradis for what you use to do
 16| 33| do the disbeliev await anyth except that the angel should come to them or there come the command of your lord thu did those do befor them and allah wrong them not but they had been wrong themselv
 16| 34| so they were struck by the evil consequ of what they did and were envelop by what they use to ridicul
 16| 35| and those who associ other with allah say if allah had will we would not have worship anyth other than him neither we nor our father nor would we have forbidden anyth through other than him thu did those do befor them so is there upon the messeng except the duti of clear notif
 16| 36| and we certainli sent into everi nation a messeng say worship allah and avoid taghut and among them were those whom allah guid and among them were those upon whom error wa deservedli decre so proceed through the earth and observ how wa the end of the denier
 16| 37| even if you should strive for their guidanc o muhammad inde allah doe not guid those he send astray and they will have no helper
 16| 38| and they swear by allah their strongest oath that allah will not resurrect one who die but ye it is a true promis bind upon him but most of the peopl do not know
 16| 39| it is so he will make clear to them the truth of that wherein they differ and so those who have disbeliev may know that they were liar
 16| 40| inde our word to a thing when we intend it is but that we say to it be and it is
 16| 41| and those who emigr for the caus of allah after they had been wrong we will sure settl them in thi world in a good place but the reward of the hereaft is greater if onli they could know

 17|107| say believ in it or do not believ inde those who were given knowledg befor it when it is recit to them they fall upon their face in prostrat
 17|108| and they say exalt is our lord inde the promis of our lord ha been fulfil
 17|109| and they fall upon their face weep and the quran increas them in humbl submiss
 17|110| say call upon allah or call upon the most merci whichev name you call to him belong the best name and do not recit too loudli in your prayer or too quietli but seek between that an intermedi way
 17|111| and say prais to allah who ha not taken a son and ha had no partner in hi dominion and ha no need of a protector out of weak and glorifi him with great glorif
 18|  1| all prais is due to allah who ha sent down upon hi servant the book and ha not made therein ani devianc
 18|  2| he ha made it straight to warn of sever punish from him and to give good tide to the believ who do righteou deed that they will have a good reward
 18|  3| in which they will remain forev
 18|  4| and to warn those who say allah ha taken a son
 18|  5| they have no knowledg of it nor had their father grave is the word that come out of their mouth they speak not except a lie
 18|  6| then perhap you would kill yourself through grief over them o muhammad if they do not believ in thi messag and out of sorrow
 18|  7| inde we have made that which is on the earth adorn for it that we may test them as to which of them is best in deed
 18|  8| and inde we will make that which is upon it into a barren ground
 18|  9| or have you thought that the companion of the cave and the inscript were among our sign a wonder
 18| 10| mention when the youth retreat to the cave and said our lord grant us from yourself merci and prepar for us from our affair right guidanc
 18| 11| so we cast a cover of sleep over their ear within the cave for a number of year
 18| 12| then we awaken them that we might show which of the two faction wa most precis in calcul what extent they had remain in time
 18| 13| it is we who relat to you o muhammad their stori in truth inde they were youth who believ in their lord and we increas them in guidanc
 18| 14| and we made firm their heart when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth never will we invok besid him ani deiti we would have certainli spoken then an excess transgress
 18| 15| these our peopl have taken besid him deiti whi do they not bring for worship of them a clear author and who is more unjust than one who invent about allah a lie
 18| 16| the youth said to one anoth and when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than allah retreat to the cave your lord will spread out for you of hi merci and will prepar for you from your affair facil
 18| 17| and had you been present you would see the sun when it rose inclin away from their cave on the right and when it set pass away from them on the left while they were lay within an open space thereof that wa from the sign of allah he whom allah guid is the rightli guid but he whom he leav astray never will you find for him a protect guid
 18| 18| and you would think them awak while they were asleep and we turn them to the right and to the left while their dog stretch hi foreleg at the entranc if you had look at them you would have turn from them in flight and been fill by them with terror
 18| 19| and similarli we awaken them that they might question one anoth said a speaker from among them how long have you remain here they said we have remain a day or part of a day they said your lord is most know of how long you remain so send one of you with thi silver coin of your to the citi and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provis from it and let him be cautiou and let no one be awar of you
 18| 20| inde if they come to know of you they will stone you or return you to their religion and never would you succeed then ever
 18| 21| and similarli we caus them to be found that they who found them would know that the promis of allah is truth and that of the hour there is no doubt that wa when they disput among themselv about their affair and then said construct over them a structur their lord is most know about them said those who prevail in the matter we will sure take for ourselv over them a masjid
 18| 22| they will say there were three the fourth of them be their dog and they will say there were five the sixth of them be their dog guess at the unseen and they will say there were seven and the eighth of them wa their dog say o muhammad my lord is most know of their number none know them except a few so do not argu about them except with an obviou argument and do not inquir about them among the specul from anyon
 18| 23| and never say of anyth inde i will do that tomorrow
 18| 24| except when ad if allah will and rememb your lord when you forget it and say perhap my lord will guid me to what is nearer than thi to right conduct
 18| 25| and they remain in their cave for three hundr year and exceed by nine
 18| 26| say allah is most know of how long they remain he ha knowledg of the unseen aspect of the heaven and the earth how see is he and how hear they have not besid him ani protector and he share not hi legisl with anyon
 18| 27| and recit o muhammad what ha been reveal to you of the book of your lord there is no changer of hi word and never will you find in other than him a refug
 18| 28| and keep yourself patient by be with those who call upon their lord in the morn and the even seek hi counten and let not your eye pass beyond them desir adorn of the worldli life and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembr and who follow hi desir and whose affair is ever in neglect
 18| 29| and say the truth is from your lord so whoever will let him believ and whoever will let him disbeliev inde we have prepar for the wrongdoer a fire whose wall will surround them and if they call for relief they will be reliev with water like murki oil which scald their face wretch is the drink and evil is the rest place
 18| 30| inde those who have believ and done righteou deed inde we will not allow to be lost the reward of ani who did well in deed
 18| 31| those will have garden of perpetu resid beneath them river will flow they will be adorn therein with bracelet of gold and will wear green garment of fine silk and brocad reclin therein on adorn couch excel is the reward and good is the rest place
 18| 32| and present to them an exampl of two men we grant to one of them two garden of grapevin and we border them with palm tree and place between them field of crop
 18| 33| each of the two garden produc it fruit and did not fall short thereof in anyth and we caus to gush forth within them a river
 18| 34| and he had fruit so he said to hi companion while he wa convers with him i am greater than you in wealth and mightier in number of men
 18| 35| and he enter hi garden while he wa unjust to himself he said i do not think that thi will perish ever
 18| 36| and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be brought back to my lord i will sure find better than thi as a return
 18| 37| hi companion said to him while he wa convers with him have you disbeliev in he who creat you from dust and then from a spermdrop and then proport you as a man
 18| 38| but as for me he is allah my lord and i do not associ with my lord anyon
 18| 39| and whi did you when you enter your garden not say what allah will ha occur there is no power except in allah although you see me less than you in wealth and children
 18| 40| it may be that my lord will give me someth better than your garden and will send upon it a calam from the sky and it will becom a smooth dusti ground
 18| 41| or it water will becom sunken into the earth so you would never be abl to seek it
 18| 42| and hi fruit were encompass by ruin so he began to turn hi hand about in dismay over what he had spent on it while it had collaps upon it trellis and said oh i wish i had not associ with my lord anyon
 18| 43| and there wa for him no compani to aid him other than allah nor could he defend himself
 18| 44| there the author is complet for allah the truth he is best in reward and best in outcom
 18| 45| and present to them the exampl of the life of thi world it be like rain which we send down from the sky and the veget of the earth mingl with it and then it becom dri remnant scatter by the wind and allah is ever over all thing perfect in abil
 18| 46| wealth and children are but adorn of the worldli life but the endur good deed are better to your lord for reward and better for one hope
 18| 47| and warn of the day when we will remov the mountain and you will see the earth promin and we will gather them and not leav behind from them anyon
 18| 48| and they will be present befor your lord in row and he will say you have certainli come to us just as we creat you the first time but you claim that we would never make for you an appoint
 18| 49| and the record of deed will be place open and you will see the crimin fear of that within it and they will say oh woe to us what is thi book that leav noth small or great except that it ha enumer it and they will find what they did present befor them and your lord doe injustic to no one
 18| 50| and mention when we said to the angel prostrat to adam and they prostrat except for ible he wa of the jinn and depart from the command of hi lord then will you take him and hi descend as alli other than me while they are enemi to you wretch it is for the wrongdoer as an exchang
 18| 51| i did not make them wit to the creation of the heaven and the earth or to the creation of themselv and i would not have taken the misguid as assist
 18| 52| and warn of the day when he will say call my partner whom you claim and they will invok them but they will not respond to them and we will put between them a valley of destruct
 18| 53| and the crimin will see the fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein and they will not find from it a way elsewher
 18| 54| and we have certainli diversifi in thi quran for the peopl from everi kind of exampl but man ha ever been most of anyth prone to disput
 18| 55| and noth ha prevent the peopl from believ when guidanc came to them and from ask forgiv of their lord except that there must befal them the accustom preced of the former peopl or that the punish should come directli befor them
 18| 56| and we send not the messeng except as bringer of good tide and warner and those who disbeliev disput by use falsehood to attempt to invalid therebi the truth and have taken my vers and that of which they are warn in ridicul
 18| 57| and who is more unjust than one who is remind of the vers of hi lord but turn away from them and forget what hi hand have put forth inde we have place over their heart cover lest they understand it and in their ear deaf and if you invit them to guidanc they will never be guid then ever
 18| 58| and your lord is the forgiv full of merci if he were to impos blame upon them for what they earn he would have hasten for them the punish rather for them is an appoint from which they will never find an escap
 18| 59| and those citi we destroy them when they wrong and we made for their destruct an appoint time
 18| 60| and mention when mose said to hi servant i will not ceas travel until i reach the junction of the two sea or continu for a long period
 18| 61| but when they reach the junction between them they forgot their fish and it took it cours into the sea slip away
 18| 62| so when they had pass beyond it mose said to hi boy bring us our morn meal we have certainli suffer in thi our journey much fatigu
 18| 63| he said did you see when we retir to the rock inde i forgot there the fish and none made me forget it except satan that i should mention it and it took it cours into the sea amazingli
 18| 64| mose said that is what we were seek so they return follow their footprint
 18| 65| and they found a servant from among our servant to whom we had given merci from us and had taught him from us a certain knowledg
 18| 66| mose said to him may i follow you on the condit that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement
 18| 67| he said inde with me you will never be abl to have patienc
 18| 68| and how can you have patienc for what you do not encompass in knowledg
 18| 69| mose said you will find me if allah will patient and i will not disobey you in ani order
 18| 70| he said then if you follow me do not ask me about anyth until i make to you about it mention
 18| 71| so they set out until when they had embark on the ship alkhidh r tore it open mose said have you torn it open to drown it peopl you have certainli done a grave thing
 18| 72| alkhidh r said did i not say that with me you would never be abl to have patienc
 18| 73| mose said do not blame me for what i forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulti
 18| 74| so they set out until when they met a boy alkhidh r kill him mose said have you kill a pure soul for other than have kill a soul you have certainli done a deplor thing
 18| 75| alkhidh r said did i not tell you that with me you would never be abl to have patienc
 18| 76| mose said if i should ask you about anyth after thi then do not keep me as a companion you have obtain from me an excus
 18| 77| so they set out until when they came to the peopl of a town they ask it peopl for food but they refus to offer them hospit and they found therein a wall about to collaps so alkhidh r restor it mose said if you wish you could have taken for it a payment
 18| 78| alkhidh r said thi is part between me and you i will inform you of the interpret of that about which you could not have patienc
 18| 79| as for the ship it belong to poor peopl work at sea so i intend to caus defect in it as there wa after them a king who seiz everi good ship by forc
 18| 80| and as for the boy hi parent were believ and we fear that he would overburden them by transgress and disbelief
 18| 81| so we intend that their lord should substitut for them one better than him in puriti and nearer to merci
 18| 82| and as for the wall it belong to two orphan boy in the citi and there wa beneath it a treasur for them and their father had been righteou so your lord intend that they reach matur and extract their treasur as a merci from your lord and i did it not of my own accord that is the interpret of that about which you could not have patienc
 18| 83| and they ask you o muhammad about dhulqarnayn say i will recit to you about him a report
 18| 84| inde we establish him upon the earth and we gave him to everyth a way
 18| 85| so he follow a way
 18| 86| until when he reach the set of the sun he found it as if set in a spring of dark mud and he found near it a peopl allah said o dhulqarnayn either you punish them or els adopt among them a way of good
 18| 87| he said as for one who wrong we will punish him then he will be return to hi lord and he will punish him with a terribl punish
 18| 88| but as for one who believ and doe righteous he will have a reward of paradis and we will speak to him from our command with eas
 18| 89| then he follow a way
 18| 90| until when he came to the rise of the sun he found it rise on a peopl for whom we had not made against it ani shield
 18| 91| thu and we had encompass all that he had in knowledg
 18| 92| then he follow a way
 18| 93| until when he reach a pass between two mountain he found besid them a peopl who could hardli understand hi speech
 18| 94| they said o dhulqarnayn inde gog and magog are great corrupt in the land so may we assign for you an expenditur that you might make between us and them a barrier
 18| 95| he said that in which my lord ha establish me is better than what you offer but assist me with strength i will make between you and them a dam
 18| 96| bring me sheet of iron until when he had level them between the two mountain wall he said blow with bellow until when he had made it like fire he said bring me that i may pour over it molten copper
 18| 97| so gog and magog were unabl to pass over it nor were they abl to effect in it ani penetr
 18| 98| dhulqarnayn said thi is a merci from my lord but when the promis of my lord come he will make it level and ever is the promis of my lord true
 18| 99| and we will leav them that day surg over each other and then the horn will be blown and we will assembl them in one assembl
 18|100| and we will present hell that day to the disbeliev on display
 18|101| those whose eye had been within a cover remov from my remembr and they were not abl to hear
 18|102| then do those who disbeliev think that they can take my servant instead of me as alli inde we have prepar hell for the disbeliev as a lodg
 18|103| say o muhammad shall we believ inform you of the greatest loser as to their deed
 18|104| they are those whose effort is lost in worldli life while they think that they are do well in work
 18|105| those are the one who disbeliev in the vers of their lord and in their meet him so their deed have becom worthless and we will not assign to them on the day of resurrect ani import
 18|106| that is their recompens hell for what they deni and becaus they took my sign and my messeng in ridicul
 18|107| inde those who have believ and done righteou deed they will have the garden of paradis as a lodg
 18|108| wherein they abid etern they will not desir from it ani transfer
 18|109| say if the sea were ink for write the word of my lord the sea would be exhaust befor the word of my lord were exhaust even if we brought the like of it as a supplement
 18|110| say i am onli a man like you to whom ha been reveal that your god is one god so whoever would hope for the meet with hi lord let him do righteou work and not associ in the worship of hi lord anyon
 19|  1| kaf ha ya ayn sad
 19|  2| thi is a mention of the merci of your lord to hi servant zechariah
 19|  3| when he call to hi lord a privat supplic
 19|  4| he said my lord inde my bone have weaken and my head ha fill with white and never have i been in my supplic to you my lord unhappi
 19|  5| and inde i fear the successor after me and my wife ha been barren so give me from yourself an heir
 19|  6| who will inherit me and inherit from the famili of jacob and make him my lord pleas to you
 19|  7| he wa told o zechariah inde we give you good tide of a boy whose name will be john we have not assign to ani befor thi name
 19|  8| he said my lord how will i have a boy when my wife ha been barren and i have reach extrem old age
 19|  9| an angel said thu it will be your lord say it is easi for me for i creat you befor while you were noth
 19| 10| zechariah said my lord make for me a sign he said your sign is that you will not speak to the peopl for three night be sound
 19| 11| so he came out to hi peopl from the prayer chamber and signal to them to exalt allah in the morn and afternoon
 19| 12| allah said o john take the scriptur with determin and we gave him judgement while yet a boy
 19| 13| and affect from us and puriti and he wa fear of allah
 19| 14| and duti to hi parent and he wa not a disobedi tyrant
 19| 15| and peac be upon him the day he wa born and the day he die and the day he is rais aliv
 19| 16| and mention o muhammad in the book the stori of mari when she withdrew from her famili to a place toward the east
 19| 17| and she took in seclus from them a screen then we sent to her our angel and he repres himself to her as a wellproport man
 19| 18| she said inde i seek refug in the most merci from you so leav me if you should be fear of allah
 19| 19| he said i am onli the messeng of your lord to give you news of a pure boy
 19| 20| she said how can i have a boy while no man ha touch me and i have not been unchast
 19| 21| he said thu it will be your lord say it is easi for me and we will make him a sign to the peopl and a merci from us and it is a matter alreadi decre
 19| 22| so she conceiv him and she withdrew with him to a remot place
 19| 23| and the pain of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree she said oh i wish i had die befor thi and wa in oblivion forgotten
 19| 24| but he call her from below her do not griev your lord ha provid beneath you a stream
 19| 25| and shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree it will drop upon you ripe fresh date
 19| 26| so eat and drink and be content and if you see from among human anyon say inde i have vow to the most merci abstent so i will not speak today to ani man
 19| 27| then she brought him to her peopl carri him they said o mari you have certainli done a thing unpreced
 19| 28| o sister of aaron your father wa not a man of evil nor wa your mother unchast
 19| 29| so she point to him they said how can we speak to one who is in the cradl a child
 19| 30| jesu said inde i am the servant of allah he ha given me the scriptur and made me a prophet
 19| 31| and he ha made me bless wherev i am and ha enjoin upon me prayer and zakah as long as i remain aliv
 19| 32| and made me duti to my mother and he ha not made me a wretch tyrant
 19| 33| and peac is on me the day i wa born and the day i will die and the day i am rais aliv
 19| 34| that is jesu the son of mari the word of truth about which they are in disput
 19| 35| it is not befit for allah to take a son exalt is he when he decre an affair he onli say to it be and it is
 19| 36| jesu said and inde allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is a straight path
 19| 37| then the faction differ concern jesu from among them so woe to those who disbeliev from the scene of a tremend day
 19| 38| how clearli they will hear and see the day they come to us but the wrongdoer today are in clear error
 19| 39| and warn them o muhammad of the day of regret when the matter will be conclud and yet they are in a state of heedless and they do not believ
 19| 40| inde it is we who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it and to us they will be return
 19| 41| and mention in the book the stori of abraham inde he wa a man of truth and a prophet
 19| 42| mention when he said to hi father o my father whi do you worship that which doe not hear and doe not see and will not benefit you at all
 19| 43| o my father inde there ha come to me of knowledg that which ha not come to you so follow me i will guid you to an even path
 19| 44| o my father do not worship satan inde satan ha ever been to the most merci disobedi
 19| 45| o my father inde i fear that there will touch you a punish from the most merci so you would be to satan a companion in hellfir
 19| 46| hi father said have you no desir for my god o abraham if you do not desist i will sure stone you so avoid me a prolong time
 19| 47| abraham said peac will be upon you i will ask forgiv for you of my lord inde he is ever graciou to me
 19| 48| and i will leav you and those you invok other than allah and will invok my lord i expect that i will not be in invoc to my lord unhappi
 19| 49| so when he had left them and those they worship other than allah we gave him isaac and jacob and each of them we made a prophet
 19| 50| and we gave them of our merci and we made for them a reput of high honor
 19| 51| and mention in the book mose inde he wa chosen and he wa a messeng and a prophet
 19| 52| and we call him from the side of the mount at hi right and brought him near confid to him
 19| 53| and we gave him out of our merci hi brother aaron as a prophet
 19| 54| and mention in the book ishmael inde he wa true to hi promis and he wa a messeng and a prophet
 19| 55| and he use to enjoin on hi peopl prayer and zakah and wa to hi lord pleas
 19| 56| and mention in the book idre inde he wa a man of truth and a prophet
 19| 57| and we rais him to a high station
 19| 58| those were the one upon whom allah bestow favor from among the prophet of the descend of adam and of those we carri in the ship with noah and of the descend of abraham and israel and of those whom we guid and chose when the vers of the most merci were recit to them they fell in prostrat and weep
 19| 59| but there came after them successor who neglect prayer and pursu desir so they are go to meet evil
 19| 60| except those who repent believ and do righteous for those will enter paradis and will not be wrong at all
 19| 61| therein are garden of perpetu resid which the most merci ha promis hi servant in the unseen inde hi promis ha ever been come
 19| 62| they will not hear therein ani ill speech onli greet of peac and they will have their provis therein morn and afternoon
 19| 63| that is paradis which we give as inherit to those of our servant who were fear of allah
 19| 64| gabriel said and we angel descend not except by the order of your lord to him belong that befor us and that behind us and what is in between and never is your lord forget
 19| 65| lord of the heaven and the earth and whatev is between them so worship him and have patienc for hi worship do you know of ani similar to him
 19| 66| and the disbeliev say when i have die am i go to be brought forth aliv
 19| 67| doe man not rememb that we creat him befor while he wa noth
 19| 68| so by your lord we will sure gather them and the devil then we will bring them to be present around hell upon their knee
 19| 69| then we will sure extract from everi sect those of them who were worst against the most merci in insol
 19| 70| then sure it is we who are most know of those most worthi of burn therein
 19| 71| and there is none of you except he will come to it thi is upon your lord an inevit decre
 19| 72| then we will save those who fear allah and leav the wrongdoer within it on their knee
 19| 73| and when our vers are recit to them as clear evid those who disbeliev say to those who believ which of our two parti is best in posit and best in associ
 19| 74| and how mani a gener have we destroy befor them who were better in possess and outward appear
 19| 75| say whoever is in error let the most merci extend for him an extens in wealth and time until when they see that which they were promis either punish in thi world or the hour of resurrect they will come to know who is worst in posit and weaker in soldier
 19| 76| and allah increas those who were guid in guidanc and the endur good deed are better to your lord for reward and better for recours
 19| 77| then have you seen he who disbeliev in our vers and said i will sure be given wealth and children in the next life
 19| 78| ha he look into the unseen or ha he taken from the most merci a promis
 19| 79| no we will record what he say and extend for him from the punish extens
 19| 80| and we will inherit him in what he mention and he will come to us alon
 19| 81| and they have taken besid allah fals deiti that they would be for them a sourc of honor
 19| 82| no those god will deni their worship of them and will be against them oppon on the day of judgement
 19| 83| do you not see that we have sent the devil upon the disbeliev incit them to evil with constant incit
 19| 84| so be not impati over them we onli count out to them a limit number
 19| 85| on the day we will gather the righteou to the most merci as a deleg
 19| 86| and will drive the crimin to hell in thirst
 19| 87| none will have power of intercess except he who had taken from the most merci a coven
 19| 88| and they say the most merci ha taken for himself a son
 19| 89| you have done an atroci thing
 19| 90| the heaven almost ruptur therefrom and the earth split open and the mountain collaps in devast
 19| 91| that they attribut to the most merci a son
 19| 92| and it is not appropri for the most merci that he should take a son
 19| 93| there is no one in the heaven and earth but that he come to the most merci as a servant
 19| 94| he ha enumer them and count them a full count
 19| 95| and all of them are come to him on the day of resurrect alon

 20| 41| and i produc you for myself
 20| 42| go you and your brother with my sign and do not slacken in my remembr
 20| 43| go both of you to pharaoh inde he ha transgress
 20| 44| and speak to him with gentl speech that perhap he may be remind or fear allah
 20| 45| they said our lord inde we are afraid that he will hasten punish against us or that he will transgress
 20| 46| allah said fear not inde i am with you both i hear and i see
 20| 47| so go to him and say inde we are messeng of your lord so send with us the children of israel and do not torment them we have come to you with a sign from your lord and peac will be upon he who follow the guidanc
 20| 48| inde it ha been reveal to us that the punish will be upon whoever deni and turn away
 20| 49| pharaoh said so who is the lord of you two o mose
 20| 50| he said our lord is he who gave each thing it form and then guid it
 20| 51| pharaoh said then what is the case of the former gener
 20| 52| mose said the knowledg thereof is with my lord in a record my lord neither err nor forget
 20| 53| it is he who ha made for you the earth as a bed spread out and insert therein for you roadway and sent down from the sky rain and produc therebi categori of variou plant
 20| 54| eat therefrom and pastur your livestock inde in that are sign for those of intellig
 20| 55| from the earth we creat you and into it we will return you and from it we will extract you anoth time
 20| 56| and we certainli show pharaoh our sign all of them but he deni and refus
 20| 57| he said have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic o mose
 20| 58| then we will sure bring you magic like it so make between us and you an appoint which we will not fail to keep and neither will you in a place assign
 20| 59| mose said your appoint is on the day of the festiv when the peopl assembl at midmorn
 20| 60| so pharaoh went away put togeth hi plan and then came to mose
 20| 61| mose said to the magician summon by pharaoh woe to you do not invent a lie against allah or he will extermin you with a punish and he ha fail who invent such falsehood
 20| 62| so they disput over their affair among themselv and conceal their privat convers
 20| 63| they said inde these are two magician who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplari way
 20| 64| so resolv upon your plan and then come forward in line and he ha succeed today who overcom
 20| 65| they said o mose either you throw or we will be the first to throw
 20| 66| he said rather you throw and suddenli their rope and staff seem to him from their magic that they were move like snake
 20| 67| and he sens within himself apprehens did mose
 20| 68| allah said fear not inde it is you who are superior
 20| 69| and throw what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have craft what they have craft is but the trick of a magician and the magician will not succeed wherev he is
 20| 70| so the magician fell down in prostrat they said we have believ in the lord of aaron and mose
 20| 71| pharaoh said you believ him befor i gave you permiss inde he is your leader who ha taught you magic so i will sure cut off your hand and your feet on opposit side and i will crucifi you on the trunk of palm tree and you will sure know which of us is more sever in give punish and more endur
 20| 72| they said never will we prefer you over what ha come to us of clear proof and over he who creat us so decre whatev you are to decre you can onli decre for thi worldli life
 20| 73| inde we have believ in our lord that he may forgiv us our sin and what you compel us to do of magic and allah is better and more endur
 20| 74| inde whoever come to hi lord as a crimin inde for him is hell he will neither die therein nor live
 20| 75| but whoever come to him as a believ have done righteou deed for those will be the highest degre in posit
 20| 76| garden of perpetu resid beneath which river flow wherein they abid etern and that is the reward of one who purifi himself
 20| 77| and we had inspir to mose travel by night with my servant and strike for them a dri path through the sea you will not fear be overtaken by pharaoh nor be afraid of drown
 20| 78| so pharaoh pursu them with hi soldier and there cover them from the sea that which cover them
 20| 79| and pharaoh led hi peopl astray and did not guid them
 20| 80| o children of israel we deliv you from your enemi and we made an appoint with you at the right side of the mount and we sent down to you manna and quail
 20| 81| say eat from the good thing with which we have provid you and do not transgress or oppress other therein lest my anger should descend upon you and he upon whom my anger descend ha certainli fallen
 20| 82| but inde i am the perpetu forgiv of whoever repent and believ and doe righteous and then continu in guidanc
 20| 83| allah said and what made you hasten from your peopl o mose
 20| 84| he said they are close upon my track and i hasten to you my lord that you be pleas
 20| 85| allah said but inde we have tri your peopl after you depart and the samiri ha led them astray
 20| 86| so mose return to hi peopl angri and griev he said o my peopl did your lord not make you a good promis then wa the time of it fulfil too long for you or did you wish that wrath from your lord descend upon you so you broke your promis of obedi to me
 20| 87| they said we did not break our promis to you by our will but we were made to carri burden from the ornament of the peopl of pharaoh so we threw them into the fire and thu did the samiri throw
 20| 88| and he extract for them the statu of a calf which had a low sound and they said thi is your god and the god of mose but he forgot
 20| 89| did they not see that it could not return to them ani speech and that it did not possess for them ani harm or benefit
 20| 90| and aaron had alreadi told them befor the return of mose o my peopl you are onli be test by it and inde your lord is the most merci so follow me and obey my order
 20| 91| they said we will never ceas be devot to the calf until mose return to us
 20| 92| mose said o aaron what prevent you when you saw them go astray
 20| 93| from follow me then have you disobey my order
 20| 94| aaron said o son of my mother do not seiz me by my beard or by my head inde i fear that you would say you caus divis among the children of israel and you did not observ or await my word
 20| 95| mose said and what is your case o samiri
 20| 96| he said i saw what they did not see so i took a hand of dust from the track of the messeng and threw it and thu did my soul entic me
 20| 97| mose said then go and inde it is decre for you in thi life to say no contact and inde you have an appoint in the hereaft you will not fail to keep and look at your god to which you remain devot we will sure burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast
 20| 98| your god is onli allah except for whom there is no deiti he ha encompass all thing in knowledg
 20| 99| thu o muhammad we relat to you from the news of what ha preced and we have certainli given you from us the quran
 20|100| whoever turn away from it then inde he will bear on the day of resurrect a burden
 20|101| abid etern therein and evil it is for them on the day of resurrect as a load
 20|102| the day the horn will be blown and we will gather the crimin that day blueey
 20|103| they will murmur among themselv you remain not but ten day in the world
 20|104| we are most know of what they say when the best of them in manner will say you remain not but one day
 20|105| and they ask you about the mountain so say my lord will blow them away with a blast
 20|106| and he will leav the earth a level plain
 20|107| you will not see therein a depress or an elev
 20|108| that day everyon will follow the call of the caller with no deviat therefrom and all voic will be still befor the most merci so you will not hear except a whisper of footstep
 20|109| that day no intercess will benefit except that of one to whom the most merci ha given permiss and ha accept hi word
 20|110| allah know what is present befor them and what will be after them but they do not encompass it in knowledg
 20|111| and all face will be humbl befor the everliv the sustain of exist and he will have fail who carri injustic
 20|112| but he who doe of righteou deed while he is a believ he will neither fear injustic nor depriv
 20|113| and thu we have sent it down as an arab quran and have diversifi therein the warn that perhap they will avoid sin or it would caus them remembr
 20|114| so high abov all is allah the sovereign the truth and o muhammad do not hasten with recit of the quran befor it revel is complet to you and say my lord increas me in knowledg
 20|115| and we had alreadi taken a promis from adam befor but he forgot and we found not in him determin
 20|116| and mention when we said to the angel prostrat to adam and they prostrat except ible he refus
 20|117| so we said o adam inde thi is an enemi to you and to your wife then let him not remov you from paradis so you would suffer
 20|118| inde it is promis for you not to be hungri therein or be uncloth
 20|119| and inde you will not be thirsti therein or be hot from the sun
 20|120| then satan whisper to him he said o adam shall i direct you to the tree of etern and possess that will not deterior
 20|121| and adam and hi wife ate of it and their privat part becam appar to them and they began to fasten over themselv from the leav of paradis and adam disobey hi lord and er
 20|122| then hi lord chose him and turn to him in forgiv and guid him
 20|123| allah said descend from paradis all your descend be enemi to one anoth and if there should come to you guidanc from me then whoever follow my guidanc will neither go astray in the world nor suffer in the hereaft
 20|124| and whoever turn away from my remembr inde he will have a depress life and we will gather him on the day of resurrect blind
 20|125| he will say my lord whi have you rais me blind while i wa onc see
 20|126| allah will say thu did our sign come to you and you forgot them and thu will you thi day be forgotten
 20|127| and thu do we recompens he who transgress and did not believ in the sign of hi lord and the punish of the hereaft is more sever and more endur
 20|128| then ha it not becom clear to them how mani gener we destroy befor them as they walk among their dwell inde in that are sign for those of intellig
 20|129| and if not for a word that preced from your lord punish would have been an oblig due immedi and if not for a specifi term decre
 20|130| so be patient over what they say and exalt allah with prais of your lord befor the rise of the sun and befor it set and dure period of the night exalt him and at the end of the day that you may be satisfi
 20|131| and do not extend your eye toward that by which we have given enjoy to some categori of them it be but the splendor of worldli life by which we test them and the provis of your lord is better and more endur
 20|132| and enjoin prayer upon your famili and peopl and be steadfast therein we ask you not for provis we provid for you and the best outcom is for those of righteous
 20|133| and they say whi doe he not bring us a sign from hi lord ha there not come to them evid of what wa in the former scriptur
 20|134| and if we had destroy them with a punish befor him they would have said our lord whi did you not send to us a messeng so we could have follow your vers befor we were humili and disgrac
 20|135| say each of us is wait so wait for you will know who are the companion of the sound path and who is guid
 21|  1| the time of their account ha approach for the peopl while they are in heedless turn away
 21|  2| no mention come to them anew from their lord except that they listen to it while they are at play
 21|  3| with their heart distract and those who do wrong conceal their privat convers say is thi prophet except a human be like you so would you approach magic while you are awar of it
 21|  4| the prophet said my lord know whatev is said throughout the heaven and earth and he is the hear the know
 21|  5| but they say the revel is but a mixtur of fals dream rather he ha invent it rather he is a poet so let him bring us a sign just as the previou messeng were sent with miracl
 21|  6| not a singl citi which we destroy believ befor them so will they believ
 21|  7| and we sent not befor you o muhammad except men to whom we reveal the messag so ask the peopl of the messag if you do not know
 21|  8| and we did not make the prophet form not eat food nor were they immort on earth
 21|  9| then we fulfil for them the promis and we save them and whom we will and destroy the transgressor
 21| 10| we have certainli sent down to you a book in which is your mention then will you not reason
 21| 11| and how mani a citi which wa unjust have we shatter and produc after it anoth peopl
 21| 12| and when it inhabit perceiv our punish at onc they fled from it
 21| 13| some angel said do not flee but return to where you were given luxuri and to your home perhap you will be question
 21| 14| they said o woe to us inde we were wrongdoer
 21| 15| and that declar of their did not ceas until we made them as a harvest mow down extinguish like a fire
 21| 16| and we did not creat the heaven and earth and that between them in play
 21| 17| had we intend to take a divers we could have taken it from what is with us if inde we were to do so
 21| 18| rather we dash the truth upon falsehood and it destroy it and thereupon it depart and for you is destruct from that which you describ
 21| 19| to him belong whoever is in the heaven and the earth and those near him are not prevent by arrog from hi worship nor do they tire
 21| 20| they exalt him night and day and do not slacken
 21| 21| or have men taken for themselv god from the earth who resurrect the dead
 21| 22| had there been within the heaven and earth god besid allah they both would have been ruin so exalt is allah lord of the throne abov what they describ
 21| 23| he is not question about what he doe but they will be question
 21| 24| or have they taken god besid him say o muhammad produc your proof thi quran is the messag for those with me and the messag of those befor me but most of them do not know the truth so they are turn away
 21| 25| and we sent not befor you ani messeng except that we reveal to him that there is no deiti except me so worship me
 21| 26| and they say the most merci ha taken a son exalt is he rather they are but honor servant
 21| 27| they can not preced him in word and they act by hi command
 21| 28| he know what is present befor them and what will be after them and they can not interced except on behalf of one whom he approv and they from fear of him are apprehens
 21| 29| and whoever of them should say inde i am a god besid him that one we would recompens with hell thu do we recompens the wrongdoer
 21| 30| have those who disbeliev not consid that the heaven and the earth were a join entiti and we separ them and made from water everi live thing then will they not believ
 21| 31| and we place within the earth firmli set mountain lest it should shift with them and we made therein mountain pass as road that they might be guid
 21| 32| and we made the sky a protect ceil but they from it sign are turn away
 21| 33| and it is he who creat the night and the day and the sun and the moon all heavenli bodi in an orbit are swim
 21| 34| and we did not grant to ani man befor you etern on earth so if you die would they be etern
 21| 35| everi soul will tast death and we test you with evil and with good as trial and to us you will be return
 21| 36| and when those who disbeliev see you o muhammad they take you not except in ridicul say is thi the one who insult your god and they are at the mention of the most merci disbeliev
 21| 37| man wa creat of hast i will show you my sign so do not impati urg me
 21| 38| and they say when is thi promis if you should be truth
 21| 39| if those who disbeliev but knew the time when they will not avert the fire from their face or from their back and they will not be aid
 21| 40| rather it will come to them unexpectedli and bewild them and they will not be abl to repel it nor will they be repriev
 21| 41| and alreadi were messeng ridicul befor you but those who mock them were envelop by what they use to ridicul
 21| 42| say who can protect you at night or by day from the most merci but they are from the remembr of their lord turn away
 21| 43| or do they have god to defend them other than us they are unabl even to help themselv nor can they be protect from us
 21| 44| but on the contrari we have provid good thing for these disbeliev and their father until life wa prolong for them then do they not see that we set upon the land reduc it from it border so it is they who will overcom
 21| 45| say i onli warn you by revel but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warn
 21| 46| and if as much as a whiff of the punish of your lord should touch them they would sure say o woe to us inde we have been wrongdoer
 21| 47| and we place the scale of justic for the day of resurrect so no soul will be treat unjustli at all and if there is even the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it forth and suffici are we as account
 21| 48| and we had alreadi given mose and aaron the criterion and a light and a remind for the righteou
 21| 49| who fear their lord unseen while they are of the hour apprehens
 21| 50| and thi quran is a bless messag which we have sent down then are you with it unacquaint
 21| 51| and we had certainli given abraham hi sound judgement befor and we were of him wellknow
 21| 52| when he said to hi father and hi peopl what are these statu to which you are devot
 21| 53| they said we found our father worshipp of them
 21| 54| he said you were certainli you and your father in manifest error
 21| 55| they said have you come to us with truth or are you of those who jest
 21| 56| he said no rather your lord is the lord of the heaven and the earth who creat them and i to that am of those who testifi
 21| 57| and i swear by allah i will sure plan against your idol after you have turn and gone away
 21| 58| so he made them into fragment except a larg one among them that they might return to it and question
 21| 59| they said who ha done thi to our god inde he is of the wrongdoer
 21| 60| they said we heard a young man mention them who is call abraham
 21| 61| they said then bring him befor the eye of the peopl that they may testifi
 21| 62| they said have you done thi to our god o abraham
 21| 63| he said rather thi the largest of them did it so ask them if they should be abl to speak
 21| 64| so they return to blame themselv and said to each other inde you are the wrongdoer
 21| 65| then they revers themselv say you have alreadi known that these do not speak
 21| 66| he said then do you worship instead of allah that which doe not benefit you at all or harm you
 21| 67| uff to you and to what you worship instead of allah then will you not use reason
 21| 68| they said burn him and support your god if you are to act
 21| 69| allah said o fire be cool and safeti upon abraham
 21| 70| and they intend for him harm but we made them the greatest loser
 21| 71| and we deliv him and lot to the land which we had bless for the world
 21| 72| and we gave him isaac and jacob in addit and all of them we made righteou
 21| 73| and we made them leader guid by our command and we inspir to them the do of good deed establish of prayer and give of zakah and they were worshipp of us
 21| 74| and to lot we gave judgement and knowledg and we save him from the citi that wa commit wick deed inde they were a peopl of evil defiantli disobedi
 21| 75| and we admit him into our merci inde he wa of the righteou
 21| 76| and mention noah when he call to allah befor that time so we respond to him and save him and hi famili from the great flood
 21| 77| and we save him from the peopl who deni our sign inde they were a peopl of evil so we drown them all togeth
 21| 78| and mention david and solomon when they judg concern the field when the sheep of a peopl overran it at night and we were wit to their judgement
 21| 79| and we gave understand of the case to solomon and to each of them we gave judgement and knowledg and we subject the mountain to exalt us along with david and also the bird and we were do that
 21| 80| and we taught him the fashion of coat of armor to protect you from your enemi in battl so will you then be grate
 21| 81| and to solomon we subject the wind blow forc proceed by hi command toward the land which we had bless and we are ever of all thing know
 21| 82| and of the devil were those who dive for him and did work other than that and we were of them a guardian
 21| 83| and mention job when he call to hi lord inde advers ha touch me and you are the most merci of the merci
 21| 84| so we respond to him and remov what afflict him of advers and we gave him back hi famili and the like thereof with them as merci from us and a remind for the worshipp of allah
 21| 85| and mention ishmael and idre and dhulkifl all were of the patient
 21| 86| and we admit them into our merci inde they were of the righteou
 21| 87| and mention the man of the fish when he went off in anger and thought that we would not decre anyth upon him and he call out within the dark there is no deiti except you exalt are you inde i have been of the wrongdoer
 21| 88| so we respond to him and save him from the distress and thu do we save the believ
 21| 89| and mention zechariah when he call to hi lord my lord do not leav me alon with no heir while you are the best of inheritor
 21| 90| so we respond to him and we gave to him john and amend for him hi wife inde they use to hasten to good deed and supplic us in hope and fear and they were to us humbl submiss
 21| 91| and mention the one who guard her chastiti so we blew into her garment through our angel gabriel and we made her and her son a sign for the world
 21| 92| inde thi your religion is one religion and i am your lord so worship me
 21| 93| and yet they divid their affair among themselv but all to us will return
 21| 94| so whoever doe righteou deed while he is a believ no denial will there be for hi effort and inde we of it are record
 21| 95| and there is prohibit upon the peopl of a citi which we have destroy that they will ever return
 21| 96| until when the dam of gog and magog ha been open and they from everi elev descend
 21| 97| and when the true promis ha approach then suddenli the eye of those who disbeliev will be stare in horror while they say o woe to us we had been unmind of thi rather we were wrongdoer
 21| 98| inde you disbeliev and what you worship other than allah are the firewood of hell you will be come to enter it
 21| 99| had these fals deiti been actual god they would not have come to it but all are etern therein
 21|100| for them therein is heavi sigh and they therein will not hear
 21|101| inde those for whom the best reward ha preced from us they are from it far remov
 21|102| they will not hear it sound while they are in that which their soul desir abid etern
 21|103| they will not be griev by the greatest terror and the angel will meet them say thi is your day which you have been promis
 21|104| the day when we will fold the heaven like the fold of a written sheet for the record as we began the first creation we will repeat it that is a promis bind upon us inde we will do it
 21|105| and we have alreadi written in the book of psalm after the previou mention that the land of paradis is inherit by my righteou servant
 21|106| inde in thi quran is notif for a worship peopl

 22| 70| do you not know that allah know what is in the heaven and earth inde that is in a record inde that for allah is easi
 22| 71| and they worship besid allah that for which he ha not sent down author and that of which they have no knowledg and there will not be for the wrongdoer ani helper

 23| 10| those are the inheritor
 23| 11| who will inherit alfirdau they will abid therein etern
 23| 12| and certainli did we creat man from an extract of clay
 23| 13| then we place him as a spermdrop in a firm lodg
 23| 14| then we made the spermdrop into a cling clot and we made the clot into a lump of flesh and we made from the lump bone and we cover the bone with flesh then we develop him into anoth creation so bless is allah the best of creator
 23| 15| then inde after that you are to die
 23| 16| then inde you on the day of resurrect will be resurrect

 23| 22| and upon them and on ship you are carri
 23| 23| and we had certainli sent noah to hi peopl and he said o my peopl worship allah you have no deiti other than him then will you not fear him
 23| 24| but the emin among those who disbeliev from hi peopl said thi is not but a man like yourselv who wish to take preced over you and if allah had will to send a messeng he would have sent down angel we have not heard of thi among our forefath
 23| 25| he is not but a man possess with mad so wait concern him for a time
 23| 26| noah said my lord support me becaus they have deni me

 23| 33| and the emin among hi peopl who disbeliev and deni the meet of the hereaft while we had given them luxuri in the worldli life said thi is not but a man like yourselv he eat of that from which you eat and drink of what you drink
 23| 34| and if you should obey a man like yourselv inde you would then be loser
 23| 35| doe he promis you that when you have die and becom dust and bone that you will be brought forth onc more
 23| 36| how far how far is that which you are promis

 23| 38| he is not but a man who ha invent a lie about allah and we will not believ him
 23| 39| he said my lord support me becaus they have deni me
 23| 40| allah said after a littl they will sure becom regret
 23| 41| so the shriek seiz them in truth and we made them as plant stubbl then away with the wrongdo peopl
 23| 42| then we produc after them other gener
 23| 43| no nation will preced it time of termin nor will they remain thereaft
 23| 44| then we sent our messeng in success everi time there came to a nation it messeng they deni him so we made them follow one anoth to destruct and we made them narrat so away with a peopl who do not believ
 23| 45| then we sent mose and hi brother aaron with our sign and a clear author
 23| 46| to pharaoh and hi establish but they were arrog and were a haughti peopl
 23| 47| they said should we believ two men like ourselv while their peopl are for us in servitud
 23| 48| so they deni them and were of those destroy
 23| 49| and we certainli gave mose the scriptur that perhap they would be guid
 23| 50| and we made the son of mari and hi mother a sign and shelter them within a high ground have level area and flow water
 23| 51| allah said o messeng eat from the good food and work righteous inde i of what you do am know
 23| 52| and inde thi your religion is one religion and i am your lord so fear me
 23| 53| but the peopl divid their religion among them into sect each faction in what it ha rejoic
 23| 54| so leav them in their confus for a time
 23| 55| do they think that what we extend to them of wealth and children
 23| 56| is becaus we hasten for them good thing rather they do not perceiv
 23| 57| inde they who are apprehens from fear of their lord
 23| 58| and they who believ in the sign of their lord
 23| 59| and they who do not associ anyth with their lord
 23| 60| and they who give what they give while their heart are fear becaus they will be return to their lord
 23| 61| it is those who hasten to good deed and they outstrip other therein
 23| 62| and we charg no soul except with that within it capac and with us is a record which speak with truth and they will not be wrong
 23| 63| but their heart are cover with confus over thi and they have evil deed besid disbelief which they are do
 23| 64| until when we seiz their affluent one with punish at onc they are cri to allah for help
 23| 65| do not cri out today inde by us you will not be help
 23| 66| my vers had alreadi been recit to you but you were turn back on your heel
 23| 67| in arrog regard it convers by night speak evil
 23| 68| then have they not reflect over the quran or ha there come to them that which had not come to their forefath
 23| 69| or did they not know their messeng so they are toward him disacknowledg
 23| 70| or do they say in him is mad rather he brought them the truth but most of them to the truth are avers
 23| 71| but if the truth had follow their inclin the heaven and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruin rather we have brought them their messag but they from their messag are turn away
 23| 72| or do you o muhammad ask them for payment but the reward of your lord is best and he is the best of provid
 23| 73| and inde you invit them to a straight path
 23| 74| but inde those who do not believ in the hereaft are deviat from the path
 23| 75| and even if we gave them merci and remov what wa upon them of afflict they would persist in their transgress wander blindli
 23| 76| and we had grip them with suffer as a warn but they did not yield to their lord nor did they humbl supplic and will continu thu
 23| 77| until when we have open befor them a door of sever punish immedi they will be therein in despair
 23| 78| and it is he who produc for you hear and vision and heart littl are you grate
 23| 79| and it is he who ha multipli you throughout the earth and to him you will be gather
 23| 80| and it is he who give life and caus death and hi is the altern of the night and the day then will you not reason
 23| 81| rather they say like what the former peopl said
 23| 82| they said when we have die and becom dust and bone are we inde to be resurrect
 23| 83| we have been promis thi we and our forefath befor thi is not but legend of the former peopl
 23| 84| say o muhammad to whom belong the earth and whoever is in it if you should know
 23| 85| they will say to allah say then will you not rememb
 23| 86| say who is lord of the seven heaven and lord of the great throne
 23| 87| they will say they belong to allah say then will you not fear him
 23| 88| say in whose hand is the realm of all thing and he protect while none can protect against him if you should know
 23| 89| they will say all belong to allah say then how are you delud
 23| 90| rather we have brought them the truth and inde they are liar
 23| 91| allah ha not taken ani son nor ha there ever been with him ani deiti if there had been then each deiti would have taken what it creat and some of them would have sought to overcom other exalt is allah abov what they describ concern him
 23| 92| he is knower of the unseen and the wit so high is he abov what they associ with him
 23| 93| say o muhammad my lord if you should show me that which they are promis
 23| 94| my lord then do not place me among the wrongdo peopl
 23| 95| and inde we are abl to show you what we have promis them
 23| 96| repel by mean of what is best their evil we are most know of what they describ
 23| 97| and say my lord i seek refug in you from the incit of the devil
 23| 98| and i seek refug in you my lord lest they be present with me
 23| 99| for such is the state of the disbeliev until when death come to one of them he say my lord send me back
 23|100| that i might do righteous in that which i left behind no it is onli a word he is say and behind them is a barrier until the day they are resurrect
 23|101| so when the horn is blown no relationship will there be among them that day nor will they ask about one anoth
 23|102| and those whose scale are heavi with good deed it is they who are the success
 23|103| but those whose scale are light those are the one who have lost their soul be in hell abid etern
 23|104| the fire will sear their face and they therein will have taut smile
 23|105| it will be said were not my vers recit to you and you use to deni them
 23|106| they will say our lord our wretched overcam us and we were a peopl astray
 23|107| our lord remov us from it and if we were to return to evil we would inde be wrongdoer
 23|108| he will say remain despis therein and do not speak to me
 23|109| inde there wa a parti of my servant who said our lord we have believ so forgiv us and have merci upon us and you are the best of the merci
 23|110| but you took them in mockeri to the point that they made you forget my remembr and you use to laugh at them
 23|111| inde i have reward them thi day for their patient endur that they are the attain of success
 23|112| allah will say how long did you remain on earth in number of year
 23|113| they will say we remain a day or part of a day ask those who enumer
 23|114| he will say you stay not but a littl if onli you had known
 23|115| then did you think that we creat you uselessli and that to us you would not be return

 24| 38| that allah may reward them accord to the best of what they did and increas them from hi bounti and allah give provis to whom he will without account
 24| 39| but those who disbeliev their deed are like a mirag in a lowland which a thirsti one think is water until when he come to it he find it is noth but find allah befor him and he will pay him in full hi due and allah is swift in account

 24| 45| allah ha creat everi live creatur from water and of them are those that move on their belli and of them are those that walk on two leg and of them are those that walk on four allah creat what he will inde allah is over all thing compet
 24| 46| we have certainli sent down distinct vers and allah guid whom he will to a straight path
 24| 47| but the hypocrit say we have believ in allah and in the messeng and we obey then a parti of them turn away after that and those are not believ

 24| 50| is there diseas in their heart or have they doubt or do they fear that allah will be unjust to them or hi messeng rather it is they who are the wrongdoer
 24| 51| the onli statement of the true believ when they are call to allah and hi messeng to judg between them is that they say we hear and we obey and those are the success
 24| 52| and whoever obey allah and hi messeng and fear allah and is consciou of him it is those who are the attain
 24| 53| and they swear by allah their strongest oath that if you order them they would go forth in allah s caus say do not swear such obedi is known inde allah is acquaint with that which you do
 24| 54| say obey allah and obey the messeng but if you turn away then upon him is onli that duti with which he ha been charg and upon you is that with which you have been charg and if you obey him you will be rightli guid and there is not upon the messeng except the respons for clear notif

 26|224| and the poet onli the deviat follow them
 26|225| do you not see that in everi valley they roam
 26|226| and that they say what they do not do
 26|227| except those poet who believ and do righteou deed and rememb allah often and defend the muslim after they were wrong and those who have wrong are go to know to what kind of return they will be return
 27|  1| ta seen these are the vers of the quran and a clear book
 27|  2| as guidanc and good tide for the believ
 27|  3| who establish prayer and give zakah and of the hereaft they are certain in faith
 27|  4| inde for those who do not believ in the hereaft we have made pleas to them their deed so they wander blindli
 27|  5| those are the one for whom there will be the worst of punish and in the hereaft they are the greatest loser
 27|  6| and inde o muhammad you receiv the quran from one wise and know
 27|  7| mention when mose said to hi famili inde i have perceiv a fire i will bring you from there inform or will bring you a burn torch that you may warm yourselv
 27|  8| but when he came to it he wa call bless is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it and exalt is allah lord of the world
 27|  9| o mose inde it is i allah the exalt in might the wise
 27| 10| and he wa told throw down your staff but when he saw it writh as if it were a snake he turn in flight and did not return allah said o mose fear not inde in my presenc the messeng do not fear
 27| 11| otherwis he who wrong then substitut good after evil inde i am forgiv and merci
 27| 12| and put your hand into the open of your garment at the breast it will come out white without diseas these are among the nine sign you will take to pharaoh and hi peopl inde they have been a peopl defiantli disobedi
 27| 13| but when there came to them our visibl sign they said thi is obviou magic
 27| 14| and they reject them while their inner selv were convinc thereof out of injustic and haughti so see how wa the end of the corrupt
 27| 15| and we had certainli given to david and solomon knowledg and they said prais is due to allah who ha favor us over mani of hi believ servant
 27| 16| and solomon inherit david he said o peopl we have been taught the languag of bird and we have been given from all thing inde thi is evid bounti
 27| 17| and gather for solomon were hi soldier of the jinn and men and bird and they were march in row
 27| 18| until when they came upon the valley of the ant an ant said o ant enter your dwell that you not be crush by solomon and hi soldier while they perceiv not
 27| 19| so solomon smile amus at her speech and said my lord enabl me to be grate for your favor which you have bestow upon me and upon my parent and to do righteous of which you approv and admit me by your merci into the rank of your righteou servant
 27| 20| and he took attend of the bird and said whi do i not see the hoopo or is he among the absent
 27| 21| i will sure punish him with a sever punish or slaughter him unless he bring me clear author
 27| 22| but the hoopo stay not long and said i have encompass in knowledg that which you have not encompass and i have come to you from sheba with certain news
 27| 23| inde i found there a woman rule them and she ha been given of all thing and she ha a great throne
 27| 24| i found her and her peopl prostrat to the sun instead of allah and satan ha made their deed pleas to them and avert them from hi way so they are not guid
 27| 25| and so they do not prostrat to allah who bring forth what is hidden within the heaven and the earth and know what you conceal and what you declar
 27| 26| allah there is no deiti except him lord of the great throne
 27| 27| solomon said we will see whether you were truth or were of the liar
 27| 28| take thi letter of mine and deliv it to them then leav them and see what answer they will return
 27| 29| she said o emin one inde to me ha been deliv a nobl letter
 27| 30| inde it is from solomon and inde it read in the name of allah the entir merci the especi merci
 27| 31| be not haughti with me but come to me in submiss as muslim
 27| 32| she said o emin one advis me in my affair i would not decid a matter until you wit for me
 27| 33| they said we are men of strength and of great militari might but the command is your so see what you will command
 27| 34| she said inde king when they enter a citi they ruin it and render the honor of it peopl humbl and thu do they do
 27| 35| but inde i will send to them a gift and see with what repli the messeng will return
 27| 36| so when they came to solomon he said do you provid me with wealth but what allah ha given me is better than what he ha given you rather it is you who rejoic in your gift
 27| 37| return to them for we will sure come to them with soldier that they will be powerless to encount and we will sure expel them therefrom in humili and they will be debas
 27| 38| solomon said o assembl of jinn which of you will bring me her throne befor they come to me in submiss
 27| 39| a power one from among the jinn said i will bring it to you befor you rise from your place and inde i am for thi task strong and trustworthi
 27| 40| said one who had knowledg from the scriptur i will bring it to you befor your glanc return to you and when solomon saw it place befor him he said thi is from the favor of my lord to test me whether i will be grate or ungrat and whoever is grate hi gratitud is onli for the benefit of himself and whoever is ungrat then inde my lord is free of need and gener
 27| 41| he said disguis for her her throne we will see whether she will be guid to truth or will be of those who is not guid
 27| 42| so when she arriv it wa said to her is your throne like thi she said it is as though it wa it solomon said and we were given knowledg befor her and we have been muslim in submiss to allah
 27| 43| and that which she wa worship other than allah had avert her from submiss to him inde she wa from a disbeliev peopl
 27| 44| she wa told enter the palac but when she saw it she thought it wa a bodi of water and uncov her shin to wade through he said inde it is a palac whose floor is made smooth with glass she said my lord inde i have wrong myself and i submit with solomon to allah lord of the world
 27| 45| and we had certainli sent to thamud their brother salih say worship allah and at onc they were two parti conflict
 27| 46| he said o my peopl whi are you impati for evil instead of good whi do you not seek forgiv of allah that you may receiv merci
 27| 47| they said we consid you a bad omen you and those with you he said your omen is with allah rather you are a peopl be test
 27| 48| and there were in the citi nine famili head caus corrupt in the land and not amend it affair
 27| 49| they said take a mutual oath by allah that we will kill him by night he and hi famili then we will say to hi executor we did not wit the destruct of hi famili and inde we are truth
 27| 50| and they plan a plan and we plan a plan while they perceiv not
 27| 51| then look how wa the outcom of their plan that we destroy them and their peopl all
 27| 52| so those are their hous desol becaus of the wrong they had done inde in that is a sign for peopl who know
 27| 53| and we save those who believ and use to fear allah
 27| 54| and mention lot when he said to hi peopl do you commit immor while you are see
 27| 55| do you inde approach men with desir instead of women rather you are a peopl behav ignorantli
 27| 56| but the answer of hi peopl wa not except that they said expel the famili of lot from your citi inde they are peopl who keep themselv pure
 27| 57| so we save him and hi famili except for hi wife we destin her to be of those who remain behind
 27| 58| and we rain upon them a rain of stone and evil wa the rain of those who were warn
 27| 59| say o muhammad prais be to allah and peac upon hi servant whom he ha chosen is allah better or what they associ with him
 27| 60| more precis is he not best who creat the heaven and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky caus to grow therebi garden of joy beauti which you could not otherwis have grown the tree thereof is there a deiti with allah no but they are a peopl who ascrib equal to him

 27| 62| is he not best who respond to the desper one when he call upon him and remov evil and make you inheritor of the earth is there a deiti with allah littl do you rememb
 27| 63| is he not best who guid you through the dark of the land and sea and who send the wind as good tide befor hi merci is there a deiti with allah high is allah abov whatev they associ with him
 27| 64| is he not best who begin creation and then repeat it and who provid for you from the heaven and earth is there a deiti with allah say produc your proof if you should be truth
 27| 65| say none in the heaven and earth know the unseen except allah and they do not perceiv when they will be resurrect
 27| 66| rather their knowledg is arrest concern the hereaft rather they are in doubt about it rather they are concern it blind
 27| 67| and those who disbeliev say when we have becom dust as well as our forefath will we inde be brought out of the grave
 27| 68| we have been promis thi we and our forefath befor thi is not but legend of the former peopl
 27| 69| say o muhammad travel through the land and observ how wa the end of the crimin
 27| 70| and griev not over them or be in distress from what they conspir
 27| 71| and they say when is the fulfil of thi promis if you should be truth
 27| 72| say perhap it is close behind you some of that for which you are impati
 27| 73| and inde your lord is full of bounti for the peopl but most of them do not show gratitud
 27| 74| and inde your lord know what their breast conceal and what they declar
 27| 75| and there is noth conceal within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear regist
 27| 76| inde thi quran relat to the children of israel most of that over which they disagre
 27| 77| and inde it is guidanc and merci for the believ
 27| 78| inde your lord will judg between them by hi wise judgement and he is the exalt in might the know
 27| 79| so reli upon allah inde you are upon the clear truth
 27| 80| inde you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turn their back retreat
 27| 81| and you can not guid the blind away from their error you will onli make hear those who believ in our vers so they are muslim submit to allah
 27| 82| and when the word befal them we will bring forth for them a creatur from the earth speak to them say that the peopl were of our vers not certain in faith
 27| 83| and warn of the day when we will gather from everi nation a compani of those who deni our sign and they will be driven in row
 27| 84| until when they arriv at the place of judgement he will say did you deni my sign while you encompass them not in knowledg or what wa it that you were do
 27| 85| and the decre will befal them for the wrong they did and they will not be abl to speak
 27| 86| do they not see that we made the night that they may rest therein and the day give sight inde in that are sign for a peopl who believ
 27| 87| and warn of the day the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth will be terrifi except whom allah will and all will come to him humbl
 27| 88| and you see the mountain think them rigid while they will pass as the pass of cloud it is the work of allah who perfect all thing inde he is acquaint with that which you do
 27| 89| whoever come at judgement with a good deed will have better than it and they from the terror of that day will be safe
 27| 90| and whoever come with an evil deed their face will be overturn into the fire and it will be said are you recompens except for what you use to do
 27| 91| say o muhammad i have onli been command to worship the lord of thi citi who made it sacr and to whom belong all thing and i am command to be of the muslim those who submit to allah
 27| 92| and to recit the quran and whoever is guid is onli guid for the benefit of himself and whoever stray say i am onli one of the warner
 27| 93| and say all prais is due to allah he will show you hi sign and you will recogn them and your lord is not unawar of what you do
 28|  1| ta seen meem
 28|  2| these are the vers of the clear book
 28|  3| we recit to you from the news of mose and pharaoh in truth for a peopl who believ
 28|  4| inde pharaoh exalt himself in the land and made it peopl into faction oppress a sector among them slaughter their newborn son and keep their femal aliv inde he wa of the corrupt
 28|  5| and we want to confer favor upon those who were oppress in the land and make them leader and make them inheritor
 28|  6| and establish them in the land and show pharaoh and hi minist haman and their soldier through them that which they had fear
 28|  7| and we inspir to the mother of mose suckl him but when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear and do not griev inde we will return him to you and will make him one of the messeng
 28|  8| and the famili of pharaoh pick him up out of the river so that he would becom to them an enemi and a caus of grief inde pharaoh and haman and their soldier were deliber sinner
 28|  9| and the wife of pharaoh said he will be a comfort of the eye for me and for you do not kill him perhap he may benefit us or we may adopt him as a son and they perceiv not
 28| 10| and the heart of mose mother becam empti of all els she wa about to disclos the matter concern him had we not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believ
 28| 11| and she said to hi sister follow him so she watch him from a distanc while they perceiv not
 28| 12| and we had prevent from him all wet nurs befor so she said shall i direct you to a household that will be respons for him for you while they are to him for hi upbring sincer
 28| 13| so we restor him to hi mother that she might be content and not griev and that she would know that the promis of allah is true but most of the peopl do not know
 28| 14| and when he attain hi full strength and wa mental matur we bestow upon him judgement and knowledg and thu do we reward the doer of good
 28| 15| and he enter the citi at a time of inattent by it peopl and found therein two men fight one from hi faction and one from among hi enemi and the one from hi faction call for help to him against the one from hi enemi so mose struck him and unintent kill him mose said thi is from the work of satan inde he is a manifest mislead enemi
 28| 16| he said my lord inde i have wrong myself so forgiv me and he forgav him inde he is the forgiv the merci
 28| 17| he said my lord for the favor you bestow upon me i will never be an assist to the crimin
 28| 18| and he becam insid the citi fear and anticip exposur when suddenli the one who sought hi help the previou day cri out to him onc again mose said to him inde you are an evid persist deviat
 28| 19| and when he want to strike the one who wa an enemi to both of them he said o mose do you intend to kill me as you kill someon yesterday you onli want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amend
 28| 20| and a man came from the farthest end of the citi run he said o mose inde the emin one are confer over you intend to kill you so leav the citi inde i am to you of the sincer advisor
 28| 21| so he left it fear and anticip apprehens he said my lord save me from the wrongdo peopl
 28| 22| and when he direct himself toward madyan he said perhap my lord will guid me to the sound way
 28| 23| and when he came to the well of madyan he found there a crowd of peopl water their flock and he found asid from them two women drive back their flock he said what is your circumst they said we do not water until the shepherd dispatch their flock and our father is an old man
 28| 24| so he water their flock for them then he went back to the shade and said my lord inde i am for whatev good you would send down to me in need
 28| 25| then one of the two women came to him walk with shyness she said inde my father invit you that he may reward you for have water for us so when he came to him and relat to him the stori he said fear not you have escap from the wrongdo peopl
 28| 26| one of the women said o my father hire him inde the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthi
 28| 27| he said inde i wish to wed you one of these my two daughter on the condit that you serv me for eight year but if you complet ten it will be as a favor from you and i do not wish to put you in difficulti you will find me if allah will from among the righteou
 28| 28| mose said that is establish between me and you whichev of the two term i complet there is no injustic to me and allah over what we say is wit
 28| 29| and when mose had complet the term and wa travel with hi famili he perceiv from the direct of the mount a fire he said to hi famili stay here inde i have perceiv a fire perhap i will bring you from there some inform or burn wood from the fire that you may warm yourselv
 28| 30| but when he came to it he wa call from the right side of the valley in a bless spot from the tree o mose inde i am allah lord of the world
 28| 31| and he wa told throw down your staff but when he saw it writh as if it wa a snake he turn in flight and did not return allah said o mose approach and fear not inde you are of the secur
 28| 32| insert your hand into the open of your garment it will come out white without diseas and draw in your arm close to you as prevent from fear for those are two proof from your lord to pharaoh and hi establish inde they have been a peopl defiantli disobedi
 28| 33| he said my lord inde i kill from among them someon and i fear they will kill me
 28| 34| and my brother aaron is more fluent than me in tongu so send him with me as support verifi me inde i fear that they will deni me
 28| 35| allah said we will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremaci so they will not reach you it will be through our sign you and those who follow you will be the predomin
 28| 36| but when mose came to them with our sign as clear evid they said thi is not except invent magic and we have not heard of thi religion among our forefath
 28| 37| and mose said my lord is more know than we or you of who ha come with guidanc from him and to whom will be success in the home inde wrongdoer do not succeed
 28| 38| and pharaoh said o emin one i have not known you to have a god other than me then ignit for me o haman a fire upon the clay and make for me a tower that i may look at the god of mose and inde i do think he is among the liar
 28| 39| and he wa arrog he and hi soldier in the land without right and they thought that they would not be return to us
 28| 40| so we took him and hi soldier and threw them into the sea so see how wa the end of the wrongdoer
 28| 41| and we made them leader invit to the fire and on the day of resurrect they will not be help
 28| 42| and we caus to overtak them in thi world a curs and on the day of resurrect they will be of the despis
 28| 43| and we gave mose the scriptur after we had destroy the former gener as enlighten for the peopl and guidanc and merci that they might be remind
 28| 44| and you o muhammad were not on the western side of the mount when we reveal to mose the command and you were not among the wit to that
 28| 45| but we produc mani gener after mose and prolong wa their durat and you were not a resid among the peopl of madyan recit to them our vers but we were sender of thi messag
 28| 46| and you were not at the side of the mount when we call mose but were sent as a merci from your lord to warn a peopl to whom no warner had come befor you that they might be remind
 28| 47| and if not that a disast should strike them for what their hand put forth of sin and they would say our lord whi did you not send us a messeng so we could have follow your vers and been among the believ
 28| 48| but when the truth came to them from us they said whi wa he not given like that which wa given to mose did they not disbeliev in that which wa given to mose befor they said they are but two work of magic support each other and inde we are in both disbeliev
 28| 49| say then bring a scriptur from allah which is more guid than either of them that i may follow it if you should be truth
 28| 50| but if they do not respond to you then know that they onli follow their own desir and who is more astray than one who follow hi desir without guidanc from allah inde allah doe not guid the wrongdo peopl
 28| 51| and we have repeatedli convey to them the quran that they might be remind
 28| 52| those to whom we gave the scriptur befor it they are believ in it
 28| 53| and when it is recit to them they say we have believ in it inde it is the truth from our lord inde we were even befor it muslim submit to allah
 28| 54| those will be given their reward twice for what they patient endur and becaus they avert evil through good and from what we have provid them they spend
 28| 55| and when they hear ill speech they turn away from it and say for us are our deed and for you are your deed peac will be upon you we seek not the ignor
 28| 56| inde o muhammad you do not guid whom you like but allah guid whom he will and he is most know of the rightli guid
 28| 57| and they say if we were to follow the guidanc with you we would be swept from our land have we not establish for them a safe sanctuari to which are brought the fruit of all thing as provis from us but most of them do not know
 28| 58| and how mani a citi have we destroy that wa insol in it way of live and those are their dwell which have not been inhabit after them except briefli and it is we who were the inheritor
 28| 59| and never would your lord have destroy the citi until he had sent to their mother a messeng recit to them our vers and we would not destroy the citi except while their peopl were wrongdoer
 28| 60| and whatev thing you peopl have been given it is onli for the enjoy of worldli life and it adorn and what is with allah is better and more last so will you not use reason
 28| 61| then is he whom we have promis a good promis which he will obtain like he for whom we provid enjoy of worldli life but then he is on the day of resurrect among those present for punish in hell
 28| 62| and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partner which you use to claim
 28| 63| those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say our lord these are the one we led to error we led them to error just as we were in error we declar our disassoci from them to you they did not use to worship us
 28| 64| and it will be said invok your partner and they will invok them but they will not respond to them and they will see the punish if onli they had follow guidanc
 28| 65| and mention the day he will call them and say what did you answer the messeng
 28| 66| but the inform will be unappar to them that day so they will not be abl to ask one anoth
 28| 67| but as for one who had repent believ and done righteous it is promis by allah that he will be among the success
 28| 68| and your lord creat what he will and choos not for them wa the choic exalt is allah and high abov what they associ with him
 28| 69| and your lord know what their breast conceal and what they declar
 28| 70| and he is allah there is no deiti except him to him is due all prais in the first life and the hereaft and hi is the final decis and to him you will be return
 28| 71| say have you consid if allah should make for you the night continu until the day of resurrect what deiti other than allah could bring you light then will you not hear
 28| 72| say have you consid if allah should make for you the day continu until the day of resurrect what deiti other than allah could bring you a night in which you may rest then will you not see
 28| 73| and out of hi merci he made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and by day seek from hi bounti and that perhap you will be grate
 28| 74| and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partner which you use to claim
 28| 75| and we will extract from everi nation a wit and say produc your proof and they will know that the truth belong to allah and lost from them is that which they use to invent
 28| 76| inde qarun wa from the peopl of mose but he tyrann them and we gave him of treasur whose key would burden a band of strong men thereupon hi peopl said to him do not exult inde allah doe not like the exult
 28| 77| but seek through that which allah ha given you the home of the hereaft and yet do not forget your share of the world and do good as allah ha done good to you and desir not corrupt in the land inde allah doe not like corrupt
 28| 78| he said i wa onli given it becaus of knowledg i have did he not know that allah had destroy befor him of gener those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumul of wealth but the crimin about their sin will not be ask
 28| 79| so he came out befor hi peopl in hi adorn those who desir the worldli life said oh would that we had like what wa given to qarun inde he is one of great fortun
 28| 80| but those who had been given knowledg said woe to you the reward of allah is better for he who believ and doe righteous and none are grant it except the patient
 28| 81| and we caus the earth to swallow him and hi home and there wa for him no compani to aid him other than allah nor wa he of those who could defend themselv
 28| 82| and those who had wish for hi posit the previou day began to say oh how allah extend provis to whom he will of hi servant and restrict it if not that allah had confer favor on us he would have caus it to swallow us oh how the disbeliev do not succeed
 28| 83| that home of the hereaft we assign to those who do not desir exalted upon the earth or corrupt and the best outcom is for the righteou
 28| 84| whoever come on the day of judgement with a good deed will have better than it and whoever come with an evil deed then those who did evil deed will not be recompens except as much as what they use to do
 28| 85| inde o muhammad he who impos upon you the quran will take you back to a place of return say my lord is most know of who bring guidanc and who is in clear error
 28| 86| and you were not expect that the book would be convey to you but it is a merci from your lord so do not be an assist to the disbeliev
 28| 87| and never let them avert you from the vers of allah after they have been reveal to you and invit peopl to your lord and never be of those who associ other with allah
 28| 88| and do not invok with allah anoth deiti there is no deiti except him everyth will be destroy except hi face hi is the judgement and to him you will be return
 29|  1| alif lam meem
 29|  2| do the peopl think that they will be left to say we believ and they will not be tri
 29|  3| but we have certainli tri those befor them and allah will sure make evid those who are truth and he will sure make evid the liar
 29|  4| or do those who do evil deed think they can outrun us evil is what they judg
 29|  5| whoever should hope for the meet with allah inde the term decre by allah is come and he is the hear the know
 29|  6| and whoever strive onli strive for the benefit of himself inde allah is free from need of the world
 29|  7| and those who believ and do righteou deed we will sure remov from them their misde and will sure reward them accord to the best of what they use to do
 29|  8| and we have enjoin upon man good to parent but if they endeavor to make you associ with me that of which you have no knowledg do not obey them to me is your return and i will inform you about what you use to do
 29|  9| and those who believ and do righteou deed we will sure admit them among the righteou into paradis
 29| 10| and of the peopl are some who say we believ in allah but when one of them is harm for the caus of allah they consid the trial of the peopl as if it were the punish of allah but if victori come from your lord they say inde we were with you is not allah most know of what is within the breast of all creatur
 29| 11| and allah will sure make evid those who believ and he will sure make evid the hypocrit
 29| 12| and those who disbeliev say to those who believ follow our way and we will carri your sin but they will not carri anyth of their sin inde they are liar
 29| 13| but they will sure carri their own burden and other burden along with their burden and they will sure be question on the day of resurrect about what they use to invent
 29| 14| and we certainli sent noah to hi peopl and he remain among them a thousand year minu fifti year and the flood seiz them while they were wrongdoer
 29| 15| but we save him and the companion of the ship and we made it a sign for the world
 29| 16| and we sent abraham when he said to hi peopl worship allah and fear him that is best for you if you should know
 29| 17| you onli worship besid allah idol and you produc a falsehood inde those you worship besid allah do not possess for you the power of provis so seek from allah provis and worship him and be grate to him to him you will be return
 29| 18| and if you peopl deni the messag alreadi nation befor you have deni and there is not upon the messeng except the duti of clear notif
 29| 19| have they not consid how allah begin creation and then repeat it inde that for allah is easi
 29| 20| say o muhammad travel through the land and observ how he began creation then allah will produc the final creation inde allah over all thing is compet
 29| 21| he punish whom he will and ha merci upon whom he will and to him you will be return
 29| 22| and you will not caus failur to allah upon the earth or in the heaven and you have not other than allah ani protector or ani helper
 29| 23| and the one who disbeliev in the sign of allah and the meet with him those have despair of my merci and they will have a pain punish
 29| 24| and the answer of abraham peopl wa not but that they said kill him or burn him but allah save him from the fire inde in that are sign for a peopl who believ
 29| 25| and abraham said you have onli taken other than allah idol as a bond of affect among you in worldli life then on the day of resurrect you will deni one anoth and curs one anoth and your refug will be the fire and you will not have ani helper
 29| 26| and lot believ him abraham said inde i will emigr to the servic of my lord inde he is the exalt in might the wise
 29| 27| and we gave to him isaac and jacob and place in hi descend prophethood and scriptur and we gave him hi reward in thi world and inde he is in the hereaft among the righteou
 29| 28| and mention lot when he said to hi peopl inde you commit such immor as no one ha preced you with from among the world
 29| 29| inde you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meet everi evil and the answer of hi peopl wa not but they said bring us the punish of allah if you should be of the truth
 29| 30| he said my lord support me against the corrupt peopl
 29| 31| and when our messeng came to abraham with the good tide they said inde we will destroy the peopl of that lot citi inde it peopl have been wrongdoer
 29| 32| abraham said inde within it is lot they said we are more know of who is within it we will sure save him and hi famili except hi wife she is to be of those who remain behind
 29| 33| and when our messeng came to lot he wa distress for them and felt for them great discomfort they said fear not nor griev inde we will save you and your famili except your wife she is to be of those who remain behind
 29| 34| inde we will bring down on the peopl of thi citi punish from the sky becaus they have been defiantli disobedi
 29| 35| and we have certainli left of it a sign as clear evid for a peopl who use reason
 29| 36| and to madyan we sent their brother shuayb and he said o my peopl worship allah and expect the last day and do not commit abus on the earth spread corrupt
 29| 37| but they deni him so the earthquak seiz them and they becam within their home corps fallen prone
 29| 38| and we destroy aad and thamud and it ha becom clear to you from their ruin dwell and satan had made pleas to them their deed and avert them from the path and they were endow with percept
 29| 39| and we destroy qarun and pharaoh and haman and mose had alreadi come to them with clear evid and they were arrog in the land but they were not outrunn of our punish
 29| 40| so each we seiz for hi sin and among them were those upon whom we sent a storm of stone and among them were those who were seiz by the blast from the sky and among them were those whom we caus the earth to swallow and among them were those whom we drown and allah would not have wrong them but it wa they who were wrong themselv
 29| 41| the exampl of those who take alli other than allah is like that of the spider who take a home and inde the weakest of home is the home of the spider if they onli knew
 29| 42| inde allah know whatev thing they call upon other than him and he is the exalt in might the wise
 29| 43| and these exampl we present to the peopl but none will understand them except those of knowledg
 29| 44| allah creat the heaven and the earth in truth inde in that is a sign for the believ
 29| 45| recit o muhammad what ha been reveal to you of the book and establish prayer inde prayer prohibit immor and wrongdo and the remembr of allah is greater and allah know that which you do
 29| 46| and do not argu with the peopl of the scriptur except in a way that is best except for those who commit injustic among them and say we believ in that which ha been reveal to us and reveal to you and our god and your god is one and we are muslim in submiss to him
 29| 47| and thu we have sent down to you the quran and those to whom we previous gave the scriptur believ in it and among these peopl of makkah are those who believ in it and none reject our vers except the disbeliev
 29| 48| and you did not recit befor it ani scriptur nor did you inscrib one with your right hand otherwis the falsifi would have had caus for doubt
 29| 49| rather the quran is distinct vers preserv within the breast of those who have been given knowledg and none reject our vers except the wrongdoer
 29| 50| but they say whi are not sign sent down to him from hi lord say the sign are onli with allah and i am onli a clear warner
 29| 51| and is it not suffici for them that we reveal to you the book which is recit to them inde in that is a merci and remind for a peopl who believ
 29| 52| say suffici is allah between me and you as wit he know what is in the heaven and earth and they who have believ in falsehood and disbeliev in allah it is those who are the loser
 29| 53| and they urg you to hasten the punish and if not for the decre of a specifi term punish would have reach them but it will sure come to them suddenli while they perceiv not
 29| 54| they urg you to hasten the punish and inde hell will be encompass of the disbeliev
 29| 55| on the day the punish will cover them from abov them and from below their feet and it is said tast the result of what you use to do
 29| 56| o my servant who have believ inde my earth is spaciou so worship onli me
 29| 57| everi soul will tast death then to us will you be return
 29| 58| and those who have believ and done righteou deed we will sure assign to them of paradis elev chamber beneath which river flow wherein they abid etern excel is the reward of the righteou worker
 29| 59| who have been patient and upon their lord reli
 29| 60| and how mani a creatur carri not it own provis allah provid for it and for you and he is the hear the know
 29| 61| if you ask them who creat the heaven and earth and subject the sun and the moon they would sure say allah then how are they delud
 29| 62| allah extend provis for whom he will of hi servant and restrict for him inde allah is of all thing know
 29| 63| and if you ask them who send down rain from the sky and give life therebi to the earth after it lifeless they would sure say allah say prais to allah but most of them do not reason
 29| 64| and thi worldli life is not but divers and amus and inde the home of the hereaft that is the etern life if onli they knew
 29| 65| and when they board a ship they supplic allah sincer to him in religion but when he deliv them to the land at onc they associ other with him
 29| 66| so that they will deni what we have grant them and they will enjoy themselv but they are go to know
 29| 67| have they not seen that we made makkah a safe sanctuari while peopl are be taken away all around them then in falsehood do they believ and in the favor of allah they disbeliev
 29| 68| and who is more unjust than one who invent a lie about allah or deni the truth when it ha come to him is there not in hell a suffici resid for the disbeliev
 29| 69| and those who strive for us we will sure guid them to our way and inde allah is with the doer of good
 30|  1| alif lam meem
 30|  2| the byzantin have been defeat
 30|  3| in the nearest land but they after their defeat will overcom
 30|  4| within three to nine year to allah belong the command befor and after and that day the believ will rejoic
 30|  5| in the victori of allah he give victori to whom he will and he is the exalt in might the merci
 30|  6| it is the promis of allah allah doe not fail in hi promis but most of the peopl do not know
 30|  7| they know what is appar of the worldli life but they of the hereaft are unawar
 30|  8| do they not contempl within themselv allah ha not creat the heaven and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specifi term and inde mani of the peopl in the matter of the meet with their lord are disbeliev
 30|  9| have they not travel through the earth and observ how wa the end of those befor them they were greater than them in power and they plow the earth and built it up more than they have built it up and their messeng came to them with clear evid and allah would not ever have wrong them but they were wrong themselv
 30| 10| then the end of those who did evil wa the worst consequ becaus they deni the sign of allah and use to ridicul them
 30| 11| allah begin creation then he will repeat it then to him you will be return
 30| 12| and the day the hour appear the crimin will be in despair
 30| 13| and there will not be for them among their alleg partner ani intercessor and they will then be disbeliev in their partner
 30| 14| and the day the hour appear that day they will becom separ
 30| 15| and as for those who had believ and done righteou deed they will be in a garden of paradis delight
 30| 16| but as for those who disbeliev and deni our vers and the meet of the hereaft those will be brought into the punish to remain
 30| 17| so exalt is allah when you reach the even and when you reach the morn
 30| 18| and to him is due all prais throughout the heaven and the earth and exalt is he at night and when you are at noon
 30| 19| he bring the live out of the dead and bring the dead out of the live and bring to life the earth after it lifeless and thu will you be brought out
 30| 20| and of hi sign is that he creat you from dust then suddenli you were human be dispers throughout the earth
 30| 21| and of hi sign is that he creat for you from yourselv mate that you may find tranquil in them and he place between you affect and merci inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought
 30| 22| and of hi sign is the creation of the heaven and the earth and the divers of your languag and your color inde in that are sign for those of knowledg
 30| 23| and of hi sign is your sleep by night and day and your seek of hi bounti inde in that are sign for a peopl who listen
 30| 24| and of hi sign is that he show you the lightn caus fear and aspir and he send down rain from the sky by which he bring to life the earth after it lifeless inde in that are sign for a peopl who use reason
 30| 25| and of hi sign is that the heaven and earth remain by hi command then when he call you with a singl call from the earth immedi you will come forth
 30| 26| and to him belong whoever is in the heaven and earth all are to him devoutli obedi
 30| 27| and it is he who begin creation then he repeat it and that is even easier for him to him belong the highest attribut in the heaven and earth and he is the exalt in might the wise
 30| 28| he present to you an exampl from yourselv do you have among those whom your right hand possess ani partner in what we have provid for you so that you are equal therein and would fear them as your fear of one anoth within a partnership thu do we detail the vers for a peopl who use reason
 30| 29| but those who wrong follow their own desir without knowledg then who can guid one whom allah ha sent astray and for them there are no helper
 30| 30| so direct your face toward the religion inclin to truth adher to the fitrah of allah upon which he ha creat all peopl no chang should there be in the creation of allah that is the correct religion but most of the peopl do not know
 30| 31| adher to it turn in repent to him and fear him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associ other with allah
 30| 32| or of those who have divid their religion and becom sect everi faction rejoic in what it ha
 30| 33| and when advers touch the peopl they call upon their lord turn in repent to him then when he let them tast merci from him at onc a parti of them associ other with their lord
 30| 34| so that they will deni what we have grant them then enjoy yourselv for you are go to know
 30| 35| or have we sent down to them an author and it speak of what they were associ with him
 30| 36| and when we let the peopl tast merci they rejoic therein but if evil afflict them for what their hand have put forth immedi they despair
 30| 37| do they not see that allah extend provis for whom he will and restrict it inde in that are sign for a peopl who believ
 30| 38| so give the rel hi right as well as the needi and the travel that is best for those who desir the counten of allah and it is they who will be the success
 30| 39| and whatev you give for interest to increas within the wealth of peopl will not increas with allah but what you give in zakah desir the counten of allah those are the multipli
 30| 40| allah is the one who creat you then provid for you then will caus you to die and then will give you life are there ani of your partner who doe anyth of that exalt is he and high abov what they associ with him
 30| 41| corrupt ha appear throughout the land and sea by reason of what the hand of peopl have earn so he may let them tast part of the consequ of what they have done that perhap they will return to righteous
 30| 42| say o muhammad travel through the land and observ how wa the end of those befor most of them were associ of other with allah
 30| 43| so direct your face toward the correct religion befor a day come from allah of which there is no repel that day they will be divid
 30| 44| whoever disbeliev upon him is the consequ of hi disbelief and whoever doe righteous they are for themselv prepar
 30| 45| that he may reward those who have believ and done righteou deed out of hi bounti inde he doe not like the disbeliev
 30| 46| and of hi sign is that he send the wind as bringer of good tide and to let you tast hi merci and so the ship may sail at hi command and so you may seek of hi bounti and perhap you will be grate
 30| 47| and we have alreadi sent messeng befor you to their peopl and they came to them with clear evid then we took retribut from those who commit crime and incumb upon us wa support of the believ
 30| 48| it is allah who send the wind and they stir the cloud and spread them in the sky howev he will and he make them fragment so you see the rain emerg from within them and when he caus it to fall upon whom he will of hi servant immedi they rejoic
 30| 49| although they were befor it wa sent down upon them befor that in despair
 30| 50| so observ the effect of the merci of allah how he give life to the earth after it lifeless inde that same one will give life to the dead and he is over all thing compet
 30| 51| but if we should send a bad wind and they saw their crop turn yellow they would remain thereaft disbeliev
 30| 52| so inde you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their back retreat
 30| 53| and you can not guid the blind away from their error you will onli make hear those who believ in our vers so they are muslim in submiss to allah
 30| 54| allah is the one who creat you from weak then made after weak strength then made after strength weak and white hair he creat what he will and he is the know the compet
 30| 55| and the day the hour appear the crimin will swear they had remain but an hour thu they were delud
 30| 56| but those who were given knowledg and faith will say you remain the extent of allah s decre until the day of resurrect and thi is the day of resurrect but you did not use to know
 30| 57| so that day their excus will not benefit those who wrong nor will they be ask to appeas allah
 30| 58| and we have certainli present to the peopl in thi quran from everi kind of exampl but o muhammad if you should bring them a sign the disbeliev will sure say you believ are but falsifi
 30| 59| thu doe allah seal the heart of those who do not know
 30| 60| so be patient inde the promis of allah is truth and let them not disquiet you who are not certain in faith
 31|  1| alif lam meem
 31|  2| these are vers of the wise book
 31|  3| as guidanc and merci for the doer of good
 31|  4| who establish prayer and give zakah and they of the hereaft are certain in faith
 31|  5| those are on right guidanc from their lord and it is those who are the success
 31|  6| and of the peopl is he who buy the amus of speech to mislead other from the way of allah without knowledg and who take it in ridicul those will have a humili punish
 31|  7| and when our vers are recit to him he turn away arrogantli as if he had not heard them as if there wa in hi ear deaf so give him tide of a pain punish
 31|  8| inde those who believ and do righteou deed for them are the garden of pleasur
 31|  9| wherein they abid etern it is the promis of allah which is truth and he is the exalt in might the wise
 31| 10| he creat the heaven without pillar that you see and ha cast into the earth firmli set mountain lest it should shift with you and dispers therein from everi creatur and we sent down rain from the sky and made grow therein plant of everi nobl kind
 31| 11| thi is the creation of allah so show me what those other than him have creat rather the wrongdoer are in clear error
 31| 12| and we had certainli given luqman wisdom and said be grate to allah and whoever is grate is grate for the benefit of himself and whoever deni hi favor then inde allah is free of need and praiseworthi
 31| 13| and mention o muhammad when luqman said to hi son while he wa instruct him o my son do not associ anyth with allah inde associ with him is great injustic
 31| 14| and we have enjoin upon man care for hi parent hi mother carri him increas her in weak upon weak and hi wean is in two year be grate to me and to your parent to me is the final destin
 31| 15| but if they endeavor to make you associ with me that of which you have no knowledg do not obey them but accompani them in thi world with appropri kind and follow the way of those who turn back to me in repent then to me will be your return and i will inform you about what you use to do
 31| 16| and luqman said o my son inde if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or anywher in the heaven or in the earth allah will bring it forth inde allah is subtl and acquaint
 31| 17| o my son establish prayer enjoin what is right forbid what is wrong and be patient over what befal you inde all that is of the matter requir determin
 31| 18| and do not turn your cheek in contempt toward peopl and do not walk through the earth exultantli inde allah doe not like everyon selfdelud and boast
 31| 19| and be moder in your pace and lower your voic inde the most disagre of sound is the voic of donkey

 34|  9| then do they not look at what is befor them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth if we should will we could caus the earth to swallow them or could let fall upon them fragment from the sky inde in that is a sign for everi servant turn back to allah
 34| 10| and we certainli gave david from us bounti we said o mountain repeat our prais with him and the bird as well and we made pliabl for him iron
 34| 11| command him make full coat of mail and calcul precis the link and work all of you righteous inde i of what you do am see

 34| 13| they made for him what he will of elev chamber statu bowl like reservoir and stationari kettl we said work o famili of david in gratitud and few of my servant are grate

 34| 16| but they turn away refus so we sent upon them the flood of the dam and we replac their two field of garden with garden of bitter fruit tamarisk and someth of spars lote tree
 34| 17| by that we repaid them becaus they disbeliev and do we thu repay except the ungrat
 34| 18| and we place between them and the citi which we had bless mani visibl citi and we determin between them the distanc of journey say travel between them by night or day in safeti
 34| 19| but insol they said our lord lengthen the distanc between our journey and wrong themselv so we made them narrat and dispers them in total dispers inde in that are sign for everyon patient and grate
 34| 20| and ible had alreadi confirm through them hi assumpt so they follow him except for a parti of believ
 34| 21| and he had over them no author except it wa decre that we might make evid who believ in the hereaft from who is thereof in doubt and your lord over all thing is guardian
 34| 22| say o muhammad invok those you claim as deiti besid allah they do not possess an atom weight of abil in the heaven or on the earth and they do not have therein ani partnership with him nor is there for him from among them ani assist
 34| 23| and intercess doe not benefit with him except for one whom he permit and those wait until when terror is remov from their heart they will say to one anoth what ha your lord said they will say the truth and he is the most high the grand
 34| 24| say who provid for you from the heaven and the earth say allah and inde we or you are either upon guidanc or in clear error
 34| 25| say you will not be ask about what we commit and we will not be ask about what you do

 34| 29| and they say when is thi promis if you should be truth
 34| 30| say for you is the appoint of a day when you will not remain thereaft an hour nor will you preced it
 34| 31| and those who disbeliev say we will never believ in thi quran nor in that befor it but if you could see when the wrongdoer are made to stand befor their lord refut each other word those who were oppress will say to those who were arrog if not for you we would have been believ
 34| 32| those who were arrog will say to those who were oppress did we avert you from guidanc after it had come to you rather you were crimin
 34| 33| those who were oppress will say to those who were arrog rather it wa your conspiraci of night and day when you were order us to disbeliev in allah and attribut to him equal but they will all confid regret when they see the punish and we will put shackl on the neck of those who disbeliev will they be recompens except for what they use to do
 34| 34| and we did not send into a citi ani warner except that it affluent said inde we in that with which you were sent are disbeliev
 34| 35| and they said we are more than the believ in wealth and children and we are not to be punish
 34| 36| say inde my lord extend provis for whom he will and restrict it but most of the peopl do not know
 34| 37| and it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to us in posit but it is by be one who ha believ and done righteous for them there will be the doubl reward for what they did and they will be in the upper chamber of paradis safe and secur
 34| 38| and the one who strive against our vers to caus them failur those will be brought into the punish to remain
 34| 39| say inde my lord extend provis for whom he will of hi servant and restrict it for him but whatev thing you spend in hi caus he will compens it and he is the best of provid

 34| 41| they will say exalt are you you o allah are our benefactor not them rather they use to worship the jinn most of them were believ in them
 34| 42| but today you do not hold for one anoth the power of benefit or harm and we will say to those who wrong tast the punish of the fire which you use to deni
 34| 43| and when our vers are recit to them as clear evid they say thi is not but a man who wish to avert you from that which your father were worship and they say thi is not except a lie invent and those who disbeliev say of the truth when it ha come to them thi is not but obviou magic
 34| 44| and we had not given them ani scriptur which they could studi and we had not sent to them befor you o muhammad ani warner
 34| 45| and those befor them deni and the peopl of makkah have not attain a tenth of what we had given them but the former peopl deni my messeng so how terribl wa my reproach

 34| 51| and if you could see when they are terrifi but there is no escap and they will be seiz from a place nearbi
 34| 52| and they will then say we believ in it but how for them will be the take of faith from a place far away
 34| 53| and they had alreadi disbeliev in it befor and would assault the unseen from a place far away
 34| 54| and prevent will be place between them and what they desir as wa done with their kind befor inde they were in disquiet denial
 35|  1| all prais is due to allah creator of the heaven and the earth who made the angel messeng have wing two or three or four he increas in creation what he will inde allah is over all thing compet

 35| 42| and they swore by allah their strongest oath that if a warner came to them they would be more guid than ani one of the previou nation but when a warner came to them it did not increas them except in avers
 35| 43| due to arrog in the land and plot of evil but the evil plot doe not encompass except it own peopl then do they await except the way of the former peopl but you will never find in the way of allah ani chang and you will never find in the way of allah ani alter

 36|  6| that you may warn a peopl whose forefath were not warn so they are unawar
 36|  7| alreadi the word ha come into effect upon most of them so they do not believ
 36|  8| inde we have put shackl on their neck and they are to their chin so they are with head kept aloft
 36|  9| and we have put befor them a barrier and behind them a barrier and cover them so they do not see
 36| 10| and it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believ
 36| 11| you can onli warn one who follow the messag and fear the most merci unseen so give him good tide of forgiv and nobl reward
 36| 12| inde it is we who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind and all thing we have enumer in a clear regist
 36| 13| and present to them an exampl the peopl of the citi when the messeng came to it
 36| 14| when we sent to them two but they deni them so we strengthen them with a third and they said inde we are messeng to you
 36| 15| they said you are not but human be like us and the most merci ha not reveal a thing you are onli tell lie
 36| 16| they said our lord know that we are messeng to you

 36| 19| they said your omen is with yourselv is it becaus you were remind rather you are a transgress peopl
 36| 20| and there came from the farthest end of the citi a man run he said o my peopl follow the messeng
 36| 21| follow those who do not ask of you ani payment and they are rightli guid
 36| 22| and whi should i not worship he who creat me and to whom you will be return
 36| 23| should i take other than him fals deiti while if the most merci intend for me some advers their intercess will not avail me at all nor can they save me
 36| 24| inde i would then be in manifest error
 36| 25| inde i have believ in your lord so listen to me
 36| 26| it wa said enter paradis he said i wish my peopl could know
 36| 27| of how my lord ha forgiven me and place me among the honor
 36| 28| and we did not send down upon hi peopl after him ani soldier from the heaven nor would we have done so
 36| 29| it wa not but one shout and immedi they were extinguish
 36| 30| how regret for the servant there did not come to them ani messeng except that they use to ridicul him
 36| 31| have they not consid how mani gener we destroy befor them that they to them will not return
 36| 32| and inde all of them will yet be brought present befor us
 36| 33| and a sign for them is the dead earth we have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain and from it they eat
 36| 34| and we place therein garden of palm tree and grapevin and caus to burst forth therefrom some spring
 36| 35| that they may eat of hi fruit and their hand have not produc it so will they not be grate
 36| 36| exalt is he who creat all pair from what the earth grow and from themselv and from that which they do not know
 36| 37| and a sign for them is the night we remov from it the light of day so they are left in dark
 36| 38| and the sun run on cours toward it stop point that is the determin of the exalt in might the know
 36| 39| and the moon we have determin for it phase until it return appear like the old date stalk
 36| 40| it is not allow for the sun to reach the moon nor doe the night overtak the day but each in an orbit is swim
 36| 41| and a sign for them is that we carri their forefath in a laden ship
 36| 42| and we creat for them from the like of it that which they ride
 36| 43| and if we should will we could drown them then no one respond to a cri would there be for them nor would they be save
 36| 44| except as a merci from us and provis for a time
 36| 45| but when it is said to them bewar of what is befor you and what is behind you perhap you will receiv merci
 36| 46| and no sign come to them from the sign of their lord except that they are from it turn away
 36| 47| and when it is said to them spend from that which allah ha provid for you those who disbeliev say to those who believ should we feed one whom if allah had will he would have fed you are not but in clear error
 36| 48| and they say when is thi promis if you should be truth
 36| 49| they do not await except one blast which will seiz them while they are disput
 36| 50| and they will not be abl to give ani instruct nor to their peopl can they return
 36| 51| and the horn will be blown and at onc from the grave to their lord they will hasten
 36| 52| they will say o woe to us who ha rais us up from our sleep place the repli will be thi is what the most merci had promis and the messeng told the truth
 36| 53| it will not be but one blast and at onc they are all brought present befor us
 36| 54| so today no soul will be wrong at all and you will not be recompens except for what you use to do
 36| 55| inde the companion of paradis that day will be amus in joy occup
 36| 56| they and their spous in shade reclin on adorn couch
 36| 57| for them therein is fruit and for them is whatev they request or wish
 36| 58| and peac a word from a merci lord
 36| 59| then he will say but stand apart today you crimin
 36| 60| did i not enjoin upon you o children of adam that you not worship satan for inde he is to you a clear enemi
 36| 61| and that you worship onli me thi is a straight path
 36| 62| and he had alreadi led astray from among you much of creation so did you not use reason
 36| 63| thi is the hellfir which you were promis
 36| 64| enter to burn therein today for what you use to deni
 36| 65| that day we will seal over their mouth and their hand will speak to us and their feet will testifi about what they use to earn
 36| 66| and if we will we could have obliter their eye and they would race to find the path and how could they see
 36| 67| and if we will we could have deform them paralyz them in their place so they would not be abl to proceed nor could they return
 36| 68| and he to whom we grant long life we revers in creation so will they not understand
 36| 69| and we did not give prophet muhammad knowledg of poetri nor is it befit for him it is not but a messag and a clear quran
 36| 70| to warn whoever is aliv and justifi the word against the disbeliev
 36| 71| do they not see that we have creat for them from what our hand have made graze livestock and then they are their owner
 36| 72| and we have tame them for them so some of them they ride and some of them they eat
 36| 73| and for them therein are other benefit and drink so will they not be grate
 36| 74| but they have taken besid allah fals deiti that perhap they would be help
 36| 75| they are not abl to help them and they themselv are for them soldier in attend
 36| 76| so let not their speech griev you inde we know what they conceal and what they declar
 36| 77| doe man not consid that we creat him from a mere spermdrop then at onc he is a clear adversari
 36| 78| and he present for us an exampl and forget hi own creation he say who will give life to bone while they are disintegr
 36| 79| say he will give them life who produc them the first time and he is of all creation know
 36| 80| it is he who made for you from the green tree fire and then from it you ignit
 36| 81| is not he who creat the heaven and the earth abl to creat the like of them ye it is so and he is the know creator
 36| 82| hi command is onli when he intend a thing that he say to it be and it is
 36| 83| so exalt is he in whose hand is the realm of all thing and to him you will be return
 37|  1| by those angel line up in row
 37|  2| and those who drive the cloud
 37|  3| and those who recit the messag
 37|  4| inde your god is one
 37|  5| lord of the heaven and the earth and that between them and lord of the sunris
 37|  6| inde we have adorn the nearest heaven with an adorn of star
 37|  7| and as protect against everi rebelli devil
 37|  8| so they may not listen to the exalt assembl of angel and are pelt from everi side
 37|  9| repel and for them is a constant punish

 37| 12| but you wonder while they mock
 37| 13| and when they are remind they rememb not
 37| 14| and when they see a sign they ridicul
 37| 15| and say thi is not but obviou magic
 37| 16| when we have die and becom dust and bone are we inde to be resurrect
 37| 17| and our forefath as well

 37| 54| he will say would you care to look
 37| 55| and he will look and see him in the midst of the hellfir
 37| 56| he will say by allah you almost ruin me
 37| 57| if not for the favor of my lord i would have been of those brought in to hell
 37| 58| then are we not to die

 37| 70| so they hasten to follow in their footstep
 37| 71| and there had alreadi stray befor them most of the former peopl
 37| 72| and we had alreadi sent among them warner
 37| 73| then look how wa the end of those who were warn

 37| 83| and inde among hi kind wa abraham
 37| 84| when he came to hi lord with a sound heart
 37| 85| and when he said to hi father and hi peopl what do you worship
 37| 86| is it falsehood as god other than allah you desir
 37| 87| then what is your thought about the lord of the world
 37| 88| and he cast a look at the star
 37| 89| and said inde i am about to be ill
 37| 90| so they turn away from him depart
 37| 91| then he turn to their god and said do you not eat
 37| 92| what is wrong with you that you do not speak
 37| 93| and he turn upon them a blow with hi right hand
 37| 94| then the peopl came toward him hasten

 37| 96| while allah creat you and that which you do
 37| 97| they said construct for him a furnac and throw him into the burn fire
 37| 98| and they intend for him a plan but we made them the most debas
 37| 99| and then he said inde i will go to where i am order by my lord he will guid me
 37|100| my lord grant me a child from among the righteou
 37|101| so we gave him good tide of a forbear boy

 37|106| inde thi wa the clear trial
 37|107| and we ransom him with a great sacrific
 37|108| and we left for him favor mention among later gener
 37|109| peac upon abraham

 37|112| and we gave him good tide of isaac a prophet from among the righteou
 37|113| and we bless him and isaac but among their descend is the doer of good and the clearli unjust to himself
 37|114| and we did certainli confer favor upon mose and aaron
 37|115| and we save them and their peopl from the great afflict
 37|116| and we support them so it wa they who overcam
 37|117| and we gave them the explicit scriptur
 37|118| and we guid them on the straight path
 37|119| and we left for them favor mention among later gener
 37|120| peac upon mose and aaron
 37|121| inde we thu reward the doer of good
 37|122| inde they were of our believ servant
 37|123| and inde elia wa from among the messeng
 37|124| when he said to hi peopl will you not fear allah
 37|125| do you call upon bal and leav the best of creator
 37|126| allah your lord and the lord of your first forefath
 37|127| and they deni him so inde they will be brought for punish

 37|137| and inde you pass by them in the morn
 37|138| and at night then will you not use reason
 37|139| and inde jonah wa among the messeng
 37|140| mention when he ran away to the laden ship
 37|141| and he drew lot and wa among the loser
 37|142| then the fish swallow him while he wa blameworthi
 37|143| and had he not been of those who exalt allah
 37|144| he would have remain insid it belli until the day they are resurrect
 37|145| but we threw him onto the open shore while he wa ill

 37|147| and we sent him to hi peopl of a hundr thousand or more
 37|148| and they believ so we gave them enjoy of life for a time
 37|149| so inquir of them o muhammad doe your lord have daughter while they have son
 37|150| or did we creat the angel as femal while they were wit
 37|151| unquestion it is out of their invent falsehood that they say
 37|152| allah ha begotten and inde they are liar
 37|153| ha he chosen daughter over son

 37|155| then will you not be remind
 37|156| or do you have a clear author
 37|157| then produc your scriptur if you should be truth
 37|158| and they have claim between him and the jinn a lineag but the jinn have alreadi known that they who made such claim will be brought to punish
 37|159| exalt is allah abov what they describ
 37|160| except the chosen servant of allah who do not share in that sin
 37|161| so inde you disbeliev and whatev you worship
 37|162| you can not tempt anyon away from him
 37|163| except he who is to enter and burn in the hellfir
 37|164| the angel say there is not among us ani except that he ha a known posit
 37|165| and inde we are those who line up for prayer
 37|166| and inde we are those who exalt allah
 37|167| and inde the disbeliev use to say
 37|168| if we had a messag from those of the former peopl
 37|169| we would have been the chosen servant of allah
 37|170| but they disbeliev in it so they are go to know
 37|171| and our word ha alreadi preced for our servant the messeng
 37|172| that inde they would be those given victori
 37|173| and that inde our soldier will be those who overcom
 37|174| so o muhammad leav them for a time
 37|175| and see what will befal them for they are go to see
 37|176| then for our punish are they impati
 37|177| but when it descend in their territori then evil is the morn of those who were warn

 39|  3| unquestion for allah is the pure religion and those who take protector besid him say we onli worship them that they may bring us nearer to allah in posit inde allah will judg between them concern that over which they differ inde allah doe not guid he who is a liar and confirm disbeliev
 39|  4| if allah had intend to take a son he could have chosen from what he creat whatev he will exalt is he he is allah the one the prevail
 39|  5| he creat the heaven and earth in truth he wrap the night over the day and wrap the day over the night and ha subject the sun and the moon each run it cours for a specifi term unquestion he is the exalt in might the perpetu forgiv

 39|  7| if you disbeliev inde allah is free from need of you and he doe not approv for hi servant disbelief and if you are grate he approv it for you and no bearer of burden will bear the burden of anoth then to your lord is your return and he will inform you about what you use to do inde he is know of that within the breast
 39|  8| and when advers touch man he call upon hi lord turn to him alon then when he bestow on him a favor from himself he forget him whom he call upon befor and he attribut to allah equal to mislead peopl from hi way say enjoy your disbelief for a littl inde you are of the companion of the fire
 39|  9| is one who is devoutli obedi dure period of the night prostrat and stand in prayer fear the hereaft and hope for the merci of hi lord like one who doe not say are those who know equal to those who do not know onli they will rememb who are peopl of understand
 39| 10| say o my servant who have believ fear your lord for those who do good in thi world is good and the earth of allah is spaciou inde the patient will be given their reward without account
 39| 11| say o muhammad inde i have been command to worship allah be sincer to him in religion
 39| 12| and i have been command to be the first among you of the muslim
 39| 13| say inde i fear if i should disobey my lord the punish of a tremend day
 39| 14| say allah alon do i worship sincer to him in my religion
 39| 15| so worship what you will besid him say inde the loser are the one who will lose themselv and their famili on the day of resurrect unquestion that is the manifest loss
 39| 16| they will have canopi of fire abov them and below them canopi by that allah threaten hi servant o my servant then fear me
 39| 17| but those who have avoid taghut lest they worship it and turn back to allah for them are good tide so give good tide to my servant
 39| 18| who listen to speech and follow the best of it those are the one allah ha guid and those are peopl of understand
 39| 19| then is one who ha deserv the decre of punish to be guid then can you save one who is in the fire
 39| 20| but those who have fear their lord for them are chamber abov them chamber built high beneath which river flow thi is the promis of allah allah doe not fail in hi promis
 39| 21| do you not see that allah send down rain from the sky and make it flow as spring and river in the earth then he produc therebi crop of vari color then they dri and you see them turn yellow then he make them scatter debri inde in that is a remind for those of understand
 39| 22| so is one whose breast allah ha expand to accept islam and he is upon a light from hi lord like one whose heart reject it then woe to those whose heart are harden against the remembr of allah those are in manifest error
 39| 23| allah ha sent down the best statement a consist book wherein is reiter the skin shiver therefrom of those who fear their lord then their skin and their heart relax at the remembr of allah that is the guidanc of allah by which he guid whom he will and one whom allah leav astray for him there is no guid
 39| 24| then is he who will shield with hi face the worst of the punish on the day of resurrect like one secur from it and it will be said to the wrongdoer tast what you use to earn
 39| 25| those befor them deni and punish came upon them from where they did not perceiv
 39| 26| so allah made them tast disgrac in worldli life but the punish of the hereaft is greater if they onli knew
 39| 27| and we have certainli present for the peopl in thi quran from everi kind of exampl that they might rememb
 39| 28| it is an arab quran without ani devianc that they might becom righteou
 39| 29| allah present an exampl a slave own by quarrel partner and anoth belong exclus to one man are they equal in comparison prais be to allah but most of them do not know
 39| 30| inde you are to die and inde they are to die
 39| 31| then inde you on the day of resurrect befor your lord will disput
 39| 32| so who is more unjust than one who lie about allah and deni the truth when it ha come to him is there not in hell a resid for the disbeliev
 39| 33| and the one who ha brought the truth and they who believ in it those are the righteou
 39| 34| they will have whatev they desir with their lord that is the reward of the doer of good
 39| 35| that allah may remov from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they use to do
 39| 36| is not allah suffici for hi servant prophet muhammad and yet they threaten you with those they worship other than him and whoever allah leav astray for him there is no guid
 39| 37| and whoever allah guid for him there is no mislead is not allah exalt in might and owner of retribut
 39| 38| and if you ask them who creat the heaven and the earth they would sure say allah say then have you consid what you invok besid allah if allah intend me harm are they remov of hi harm or if he intend me merci are they withhold of hi merci say suffici for me is allah upon him alon reli the wise relier
 39| 39| say o my peopl work accord to your posit for inde i am work and you are go to know
 39| 40| to whom will come a torment disgrac him and on whom will descend an endur punish
 39| 41| inde we sent down to you the book for the peopl in truth so whoever is guid it is for the benefit of hi soul and whoever goe astray onli goe astray to it detriment and you are not a manag over them
 39| 42| allah take the soul at the time of their death and those that do not die he take dure their sleep then he keep those for which he ha decre death and releas the other for a specifi term inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought
 39| 43| or have they taken other than allah as intercessor say even though they do not possess power over anyth nor do they reason
 39| 44| say to allah belong the right to allow intercess entir to him belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth then to him you will be return
 39| 45| and when allah is mention alon the heart of those who do not believ in the hereaft shrink with avers but when those worship other than him are mention immedi they rejoic
 39| 46| say o allah creator of the heaven and the earth knower of the unseen and the wit you will judg between your servant concern that over which they use to differ
 39| 47| and if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entir and the like of it with it they would attempt to ransom themselv therebi from the worst of the punish on the day of resurrect and there will appear to them from allah that which they had not taken into account
 39| 48| and there will appear to them the evil they had earn and they will be envelop by what they use to ridicul
 39| 49| and when advers touch man he call upon us then when we bestow on him a favor from us he say i have onli been given it becaus of my knowledg rather it is a trial but most of them do not know
 39| 50| those befor them had alreadi said it but they were not avail by what they use to earn
 39| 51| and the evil consequ of what they earn struck them and those who have wrong of these peopl will be afflict by the evil consequ of what they earn and they will not caus failur
 39| 52| do they not know that allah extend provis for whom he will and restrict it inde in that are sign for a peopl who believ
 39| 53| say o my servant who have transgress against themselv by sin do not despair of the merci of allah inde allah forgiv all sin inde it is he who is the forgiv the merci
 39| 54| and return in repent to your lord and submit to him befor the punish come upon you then you will not be help
 39| 55| and follow the best of what wa reveal to you from your lord befor the punish come upon you suddenli while you do not perceiv
 39| 56| lest a soul should say oh how great is my regret over what i neglect in regard to allah and that i wa among the mocker
 39| 57| or lest it say if onli allah had guid me i would have been among the righteou
 39| 58| or lest it say when it see the punish if onli i had anoth turn so i could be among the doer of good
 39| 59| but ye there had come to you my vers but you deni them and were arrog and you were among the disbeliev
 39| 60| and on the day of resurrect you will see those who lie about allah with their face blacken is there not in hell a resid for the arrog
 39| 61| and allah will save those who fear him by their attain no evil will touch them nor will they griev
 39| 62| allah is the creator of all thing and he is over all thing dispos of affair
 39| 63| to him belong the key of the heaven and the earth and they who disbeliev in the vers of allah it is those who are the loser
 39| 64| say o muhammad is it other than allah that you order me to worship o ignor one
 39| 65| and it wa alreadi reveal to you and to those befor you that if you should associ anyth with allah your work would sure becom worthless and you would sure be among the loser
 39| 66| rather worship onli allah and be among the grate
 39| 67| they have not apprais allah with true apprais while the earth entir will be within hi grip on the day of resurrect and the heaven will be fold in hi right hand exalt is he and high abov what they associ with him
 39| 68| and the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heaven and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom allah will then it will be blown again and at onc they will be stand look on
 39| 69| and the earth will shine with the light of it lord and the record of deed will be place and the prophet and the wit will be brought and it will be judg between them in truth and they will not be wrong
 39| 70| and everi soul will be fulli compens for what it did and he is most know of what they do
 39| 71| and those who disbeliev will be driven to hell in group until when they reach it it gate are open and it keeper will say did there not come to you messeng from yourselv recit to you the vers of your lord and warn you of the meet of thi day of your they will say ye but the word of punish ha come into effect upon the disbeliev

 40| 25| and when he brought them the truth from us they said kill the son of those who have believ with him and keep their women aliv but the plan of the disbeliev is not except in error
 40| 26| and pharaoh said let me kill mose and let him call upon hi lord inde i fear that he will chang your religion or that he will caus corrupt in the land
 40| 27| but mose said inde i have sought refug in my lord and your lord from everi arrog one who doe not believ in the day of account

 40| 36| and pharaoh said o haman construct for me a tower that i might reach the way
 40| 37| the way into the heaven so that i may look at the deiti of mose but inde i think he is a liar and thu wa made attract to pharaoh the evil of hi deed and he wa avert from the right way and the plan of pharaoh wa not except in ruin

 40| 71| when the shackl are around their neck and the chain they will be drag
 40| 72| in boil water then in the fire they will be fill with flame
 40| 73| then it will be said to them where is that which you use to associ with him in worship
 40| 74| other than allah they will say they have depart from us rather we did not use to invok previous anyth thu doe allah put astray the disbeliev
 40| 75| the angel will say that wa becaus you use to exult upon the earth without right and you use to behav insol

 40| 77| so be patient o muhammad inde the promis of allah is truth and whether we show you some of what we have promis them or we take you in death it is to us they will be return
 40| 78| and we have alreadi sent messeng befor you among them are those whose stori we have relat to you and among them are those whose stori we have not relat to you and it wa not for ani messeng to bring a sign or vers except by permiss of allah so when the command of allah come it will be conclud in truth and the falsifi will thereupon lose all
 40| 79| it is allah who made for you the graze anim upon which you ride and some of them you eat
 40| 80| and for you therein are other benefit and that you may realiz upon them a need which is in your breast and upon them and upon ship you are carri
 40| 81| and he show you hi sign so which of the sign of allah do you deni
 40| 82| have they not travel through the land and observ how wa the end of those befor them they were more numer than themselv and greater in strength and in impress on the land but they were not avail by what they use to earn
 40| 83| and when their messeng came to them with clear proof they mere rejoic in what they had of knowledg but they were envelop by what they use to ridicul
 40| 84| and when they saw our punish they said we believ in allah alon and disbeliev in that which we use to associ with him
 40| 85| but never did their faith benefit them onc they saw our punish it is the establish way of allah which ha preced among hi servant and the disbeliev thereupon lost all
 41|  1| ha meem
 41|  2| thi is a revel from the entir merci the especi merci
 41|  3| a book whose vers have been detail an arab quran for a peopl who know
 41|  4| as a giver of good tide and a warner but most of them turn away so they do not hear
 41|  5| and they say our heart are within cover from that to which you invit us and in our ear is deaf and between us and you is a partit so work inde we are work
 41|  6| say o muhammad i am onli a man like you to whom it ha been reveal that your god is but one god so take a straight cours to him and seek hi forgiv and woe to those who associ other with allah
 41|  7| those who do not give zakah and in the hereaft they are disbeliev
 41|  8| inde those who believ and do righteou deed for them is a reward uninterrupt
 41|  9| say do you inde disbeliev in he who creat the earth in two day and attribut to him equal that is the lord of the world
 41| 10| and he place on the earth firmli set mountain over it surfac and he bless it and determin therein it creatur susten in four day without distinct for the inform of those who ask
 41| 11| then he direct himself to the heaven while it wa smoke and said to it and to the earth come into be willingli or by compuls they said we have come willingli
 41| 12| and he complet them as seven heaven within two day and inspir in each heaven it command and we adorn the nearest heaven with lamp and as protect that is the determin of the exalt in might the know
 41| 13| but if they turn away then say i have warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck aad and thamud
 41| 14| that occur when the messeng had come to them befor them and after them say worship not except allah they said if our lord had will he would have sent down the angel so inde we in that with which you have been sent are disbeliev
 41| 15| as for aad they were arrog upon the earth without right and said who is greater than us in strength did they not consid that allah who creat them wa greater than them in strength but they were reject our sign
 41| 16| so we sent upon them a scream wind dure day of misfortun to make them tast the punish of disgrac in the worldli life but the punish of the hereaft is more disgrac and they will not be help
 41| 17| and as for thamud we guid them but they prefer blind over guidanc so the thunderbolt of humili punish seiz them for what they use to earn
 41| 18| and we save those who believ and use to fear allah
 41| 19| and mention o muhammad the day when the enemi of allah will be gather to the fire while they are driven assembl in row
 41| 20| until when they reach it their hear and their eye and their skin will testifi against them of what they use to do
 41| 21| and they will say to their skin whi have you testifi against us they will say we were made to speak by allah who ha made everyth speak and he creat you the first time and to him you are return
 41| 22| and you were not cover yourselv lest your hear testifi against you or your sight or your skin but you assum that allah doe not know much of what you do
 41| 23| and that wa your assumpt which you assum about your lord it ha brought you to ruin and you have becom among the loser
 41| 24| so even if they are patient the fire is a resid for them and if they ask to appeas allah they will not be of those who are allow to appeas
 41| 25| and we appoint for them companion who made attract to them what wa befor them and what wa behind them of sin and the word ha come into effect upon them among nation which had pass on befor them of jinn and men inde they all were loser
 41| 26| and those who disbeliev say do not listen to thi quran and speak noisili dure the recit of it that perhap you will overcom
 41| 27| but we will sure caus those who disbeliev to tast a sever punish and we will sure recompens them for the worst of what they had been do
 41| 28| that is the recompens of the enemi of allah the fire for them therein is the home of etern as recompens for what they of our vers were reject
 41| 29| and those who disbeliev will then say our lord show us those who misl us of the jinn and men so we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest
 41| 30| inde those who have said our lord is allah and then remain on a right cours the angel will descend upon them say do not fear and do not griev but receiv good tide of paradis which you were promis
 41| 31| we angel were your alli in worldli life and are so in the hereaft and you will have therein whatev your soul desir and you will have therein whatev you request or wish
 41| 32| as accommod from a lord who is forgiv and merci
 41| 33| and who is better in speech than one who invit to allah and doe righteous and say inde i am of the muslim
 41| 34| and not equal are the good deed and the bad repel evil by that deed which is better and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmiti will becom as though he wa a devot friend
 41| 35| but none is grant it except those who are patient and none is grant it except one have a great portion of good
 41| 36| and if there come to you from satan an evil suggest then seek refug in allah inde he is the hear the know
 41| 37| and of hi sign are the night and day and the sun and moon do not prostrat to the sun or to the moon but prostat to allah who creat them if it should be him that you worship
 41| 38| but if they are arrog then those who are near your lord exalt him by night and by day and they do not becom weari
 41| 39| and of hi sign is that you see the earth still but when we send down upon it rain it quiver and grow inde he who ha given it life is the giver of life to the dead inde he is over all thing compet
 41| 40| inde those who inject deviat into our vers are not conceal from us so is he who is cast into the fire better or he who come secur on the day of resurrect do whatev you will inde he is see of what you do
 41| 41| inde those who disbeliev in the messag after it ha come to them and inde it is a mighti book
 41| 42| falsehood can not approach it from befor it or from behind it it is a revel from a lord who is wise and praiseworthi
 41| 43| noth is said to you o muhammad except what wa alreadi said to the messeng befor you inde your lord is a possessor of forgiv and a possessor of pain penalti
 41| 44| and if we had made it a nonarab quran they would have said whi are it vers not explain in detail in our languag is it a foreign recit and an arab messeng say it is for those who believ a guidanc and cure and those who do not believ in their ear is deaf and it is upon them blind those are be call from a distant place
 41| 45| and we had alreadi given mose the scriptur but it came under disagr and if not for a word that preced from your lord it would have been conclud between them and inde they are concern the quran in disquiet doubt
 41| 46| whoever doe righteous it is for hi own soul and whoever doe evil doe so against it and your lord is not ever unjust to hi servant
 41| 47| to him alon is attribut knowledg of the hour and fruit emerg not from their cover nor doe a femal conceiv or give birth except with hi knowledg and the day he will call to them where are my partner they will say we announc to you that there is no longer among us ani wit to that
 41| 48| and lost from them will be those they were invok befor and they will be certain that they have no place of escap
 41| 49| man is not weari of supplic for good thing but if evil touch him he is hopeless and despair
 41| 50| and if we let him tast merci from us after an advers which ha touch him he will sure say thi is due to me and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be return to my lord inde for me there will be with him the best but we will sure inform those who disbeliev about what they did and we will sure make them tast a massiv punish
 41| 51| and when we bestow favor upon man he turn away and distanc himself but when evil touch him then he is full of extens supplic
 41| 52| say have you consid if the quran is from allah and you disbeliev in it who would be more astray than one who is in extrem dissens
 41| 53| we will show them our sign in the horizon and within themselv until it becom clear to them that it is the truth but is it not suffici concern your lord that he is over all thing a wit
 41| 54| unquestion they are in doubt about the meet with their lord unquestion he is of all thing encompass
 42|  1| ha meem
 42|  2| ayn seen qaf
 42|  3| thu ha he reveal to you o muhammad and to those befor you allah the exalt in might the wise
 42|  4| to him belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth and he is the most high the most great
 42|  5| the heaven almost break from abov them and the angel exalt allah with prais of their lord and ask forgiv for those on earth unquestion it is allah who is the forgiv the merci
 42|  6| and those who take as alli other than him allah is yet guardian over them and you o muhammad are not over them a manag
 42|  7| and thu we have reveal to you an arab quran that you may warn the mother of citi makkah and those around it and warn of the day of assembl about which there is no doubt a parti will be in paradis and a parti in the blaze
 42|  8| and if allah will he could have made them of one religion but he admit whom he will into hi merci and the wrongdoer have not ani protector or helper
 42|  9| or have they taken protector or alli besid him but allah he is the protector and he give life to the dead and he is over all thing compet
 42| 10| and in anyth over which you disagre it rule is to be refer to allah say that is allah my lord upon him i have reli and to him i turn back
 42| 11| he is creator of the heaven and the earth he ha made for you from yourselv mate and among the cattl mate he multipli you therebi there is noth like unto him and he is the hear the see
 42| 12| to him belong the key of the heaven and the earth he extend provis for whom he will and restrict it inde he is of all thing know
 42| 13| he ha ordain for you of religion what he enjoin upon noah and that which we have reveal to you o muhammad and what we enjoin upon abraham and mose and jesu to establish the religion and not be divid therein difficult for those who associ other with allah is that to which you invit them allah choos for himself whom he will and guid to himself whoever turn back to him
 42| 14| and they did not becom divid until after knowledg had come to them out of jealou animos between themselv and if not for a word that preced from your lord postpon the penalti until a specifi time it would have been conclud between them and inde those who were grant inherit of the scriptur after them are concern it in disquiet doubt
 42| 15| so to that religion of allah invit o muhammad and remain on a right cours as you are command and do not follow their inclin but say i have believ in what allah ha reveal of the quran and i have been command to do justic among you allah is our lord and your lord for us are our deed and for you your deed there is no need for argument between us and you allah will bring us togeth and to him is the final destin
 42| 16| and those who argu concern allah after he ha been respond to their argument is invalid with their lord and upon them is hi wrath and for them is a sever punish
 42| 17| it is allah who ha sent down the book in truth and also the balanc and what will make you perceiv perhap the hour is near
 42| 18| those who do not believ in it are impati for it but those who believ are fear of it and know that it is the truth unquestion those who disput concern the hour are in extrem error
 42| 19| allah is subtl with hi servant he give provis to whom he will and he is the power the exalt in might
 42| 20| whoever desir the harvest of the hereaft we increas for him in hi harvest and whoever desir the harvest of thi world we give him thereof but there is not for him in the hereaft ani share
 42| 21| or have they other deiti who have ordain for them a religion to which allah ha not consent but if not for the decis word it would have been conclud between them and inde the wrongdoer will have a pain punish
 42| 22| you will see the wrongdoer fear of what they have earn and it will certainli befal them and those who have believ and done righteou deed will be in lush region of the garden in paradis have whatev they will in the presenc of their lord that is what is the great bounti
 42| 23| it is that of which allah give good tide to hi servant who believ and do righteou deed say o muhammad i do not ask you for thi messag ani payment but onli good will through kinship and whoever commit a good deed we will increas for him good therein inde allah is forgiv and appreci
 42| 24| or do they say he ha invent about allah a lie but if allah will he could seal over your heart and allah elimin falsehood and establish the truth by hi word inde he is know of that within the breast
 42| 25| and it is he who accept repent from hi servant and pardon misde and he know what you do
 42| 26| and he answer the supplic of those who have believ and done righteou deed and increas for them from hi bounti but the disbeliev will have a sever punish
 42| 27| and if allah had extend excess provis for hi servant they would have commit tyranni throughout the earth but he send it down in an amount which he will inde he is of hi servant acquaint and see
 42| 28| and it is he who send down the rain after they had despair and spread hi merci and he is the protector the praiseworthi
 42| 29| and of hi sign is the creation of the heaven and earth and what he ha dispers throughout them of creatur and he for gather them when he will is compet
 42| 30| and whatev strike you of disast it is for what your hand have earn but he pardon much
 42| 31| and you will not caus failur to allah upon the earth and you have not besid allah ani protector or helper
 42| 32| and of hi sign are the ship in the sea like mountain
 42| 33| if he will he could still the wind and they would remain motionless on it surfac inde in that are sign for everyon patient and grate
 42| 34| or he could destroy them for what they earn but he pardon much
 42| 35| and that is so those who disput concern our sign may know that for them there is no place of escap
 42| 36| so whatev thing you have been given it is but for enjoy of the worldli life but what is with allah is better and more last for those who have believ and upon their lord reli
 42| 37| and those who avoid the major sin and immor and when they are angri they forgiv
 42| 38| and those who have respond to their lord and establish prayer and whose affair is determin by consult among themselv and from what we have provid them they spend
 42| 39| and those who when tyranni strike them they defend themselv
 42| 40| and the retribut for an evil act is an evil one like it but whoever pardon and make reconcili hi reward is due from allah inde he doe not like wrongdoer
 42| 41| and whoever aveng himself after have been wrong those have not upon them ani caus for blame
 42| 42| the caus is onli against the one who wrong the peopl and tyrann upon the earth without right those will have a pain punish
 42| 43| and whoever is patient and forgiv inde that is of the matter requir determin
 42| 44| and he whom allah send astray for him there is no protector beyond him and you will see the wrongdoer when they see the punish say is there for return to the former world ani way
 42| 45| and you will see them be expos to the fire humbl from humili look from behind a covert glanc and those who had believ will say inde the true loser are the one who lost themselv and their famili on the day of resurrect unquestion the wrongdoer are in an endur punish
 42| 46| and there will not be for them ani alli to aid them other than allah and whoever allah send astray for him there is no way
 42| 47| respond to your lord befor a day come from allah of which there is no repel no refug will you have that day nor for you will there be ani denial
 42| 48| but if they turn away then we have not sent you o muhammad over them as a guardian upon you is onli the duti of notif and inde when we let man tast merci from us he rejoic in it but if evil afflict him for what hi hand have put forth then inde man is ungrat
 42| 49| to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth he creat what he will he give to whom he will femal children and he give to whom he will male
 42| 50| or he make them both male and femal and he render whom he will barren inde he is know and compet
 42| 51| and it is not for ani human be that allah should speak to him except by revel or from behind a partit or that he send a messeng to reveal by hi permiss what he will inde he is most high and wise
 42| 52| and thu we have reveal to you an inspir of our command you did not know what is the book or what is faith but we have made it a light by which we guid whom we will of our servant and inde o muhammad you guid to a straight path
 42| 53| the path of allah to whom belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth unquestion to allah do all matter evolv
 43|  1| ha meem
 43|  2| by the clear book
 43|  3| inde we have made it an arab quran that you might understand
 43|  4| and inde it is in the mother of the book with us exalt and full of wisdom
 43|  5| then should we turn the messag away disregard you becaus you are a transgress peopl
 43|  6| and how mani a prophet we sent among the former peopl
 43|  7| but there would not come to them a prophet except that they use to ridicul him
 43|  8| and we destroy greater than them in strike power and the exampl of the former peopl ha preced
 43|  9| and if you should ask them who ha creat the heaven and the earth they would sure say they were creat by the exalt in might the know
 43| 10| the one who ha made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it road that you might be guid
 43| 11| and who send down rain from the sky in measur amount and we reviv therebi a dead land thu will you be brought forth
 43| 12| and who creat the speci all of them and ha made for you of ship and anim those which you mount
 43| 13| that you may settl yourselv upon their back and then rememb the favor of your lord when you have settl upon them and say exalt is he who ha subject thi to us and we could not have otherwis subdu it
 43| 14| and inde we to our lord will sure return
 43| 15| but they have attribut to him from hi servant a portion inde man is clearli ungrat
 43| 16| or ha he taken out of what he ha creat daughter and chosen you for have son
 43| 17| and when one of them is given good tide of that which he attribut to the most merci in comparison hi face becom dark and he suppress grief
 43| 18| so is one brought up in ornament while be dure conflict unevid attribut to allah
 43| 19| and they have made the angel who are servant of the most merci femal did they wit their creation their testimoni will be record and they will be question
 43| 20| and they said if the most merci had will we would not have worship them they have of that no knowledg they are not but falsifi
 43| 21| or have we given them a book befor the quran to which they are adher
 43| 22| rather they say inde we found our father upon a religion and we are in their footstep rightli guid
 43| 23| and similarli we did not send befor you ani warner into a citi except that it affluent said inde we found our father upon a religion and we are in their footstep follow
 43| 24| each warner said even if i brought you better guidanc than that religion upon which you found your father they said inde we in that with which you were sent are disbeliev
 43| 25| so we took retribut from them then see how wa the end of the denier
 43| 26| and mention o muhammad when abraham said to hi father and hi peopl inde i am disassoci from that which you worship
 43| 27| except for he who creat me and inde he will guid me
 43| 28| and he made it a word remain among hi descend that they might return to it
 43| 29| howev i gave enjoy to these peopl of makkah and their father until there came to them the truth and a clear messeng
 43| 30| but when the truth came to them they said thi is magic and inde we are concern it disbeliev
 43| 31| and they said whi wa thi quran not sent down upon a great man from one of the two citi
 43| 32| do they distribut the merci of your lord it is we who have apport among them their livelihood in the life of thi world and have rais some of them abov other in degre of rank that they may make use of one anoth for servic but the merci of your lord is better than whatev they accumul
 43| 33| and if it were not that the peopl would becom one commun of disbeliev we would have made for those who disbeliev in the most merci for their hous ceil and stairway of silver upon which to mount
 43| 34| and for their hous door and couch of silver upon which to reclin
 43| 35| and gold ornament but all that is not but the enjoy of worldli life and the hereaft with your lord is for the righteou
 43| 36| and whoever is blind from remembr of the most merci we appoint for him a devil and he is to him a companion
 43| 37| and inde the devil avert them from the way of guidanc while they think that they are rightli guid
 43| 38| until when he come to us at judgement he say to hi companion oh i wish there wa between me and you the distanc between the east and west how wretch a companion
 43| 39| and never will it benefit you that day when you have wrong that you are all share in the punish
 43| 40| then will you make the deaf hear o muhammad or guid the blind or he who is in clear error
 43| 41| and whether or not we take you away in death inde we will take retribut upon them
 43| 42| or whether or not we show you that which we have promis them inde we are perfect in abil
 43| 43| so adher to that which is reveal to you inde you are on a straight path
 43| 44| and inde it is a remembr for you and your peopl and you all are go to be question
 43| 45| and ask those we sent befor you of our messeng have we made besid the most merci deiti to be worship
 43| 46| and certainli did we send mose with our sign to pharaoh and hi establish and he said inde i am the messeng of the lord of the world
 43| 47| but when he brought them our sign at onc they laugh at them
 43| 48| and we show them not a sign except that it wa greater than it sister and we seiz them with afflict that perhap they might return to faith
 43| 49| and they said to mose o magician invok for us your lord by what he ha promis you inde we will be guid
 43| 50| but when we remov from them the afflict at onc they broke their word
 43| 51| and pharaoh call out among hi peopl he said o my peopl doe not the kingdom of egypt belong to me and these river flow beneath me then do you not see
 43| 52| or am i not better than thi one who is insignific and hardli make himself clear
 43| 53| then whi have there not been place upon him bracelet of gold or come with him the angel in conjunct
 43| 54| so he bluf hi peopl and they obey him inde they were themselv a peopl defiantli disobedi of allah
 43| 55| and when they anger us we took retribut from them and drown them all
 43| 56| and we made them a preced and an exampl for the later peopl
 43| 57| and when the son of mari wa present as an exampl immedi your peopl laugh aloud
 43| 58| and they said are your god better or is he they did not present the comparison except for mere argument but in fact they are a peopl prone to disput
 43| 59| jesu wa not but a servant upon whom we bestow favor and we made him an exampl for the children of israel
 43| 60| and if we will we could have made instead of you angel succeed one anoth on the earth
 43| 61| and inde jesu will be a sign for knowledg of the hour so be not in doubt of it and follow me thi is a straight path
 43| 62| and never let satan avert you inde he is to you a clear enemi
 43| 63| and when jesu brought clear proof he said i have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ so fear allah and obey me
 43| 64| inde allah is my lord and your lord so worship him thi is a straight path
 43| 65| but the denomin from among them differ and separ so woe to those who have wrong from the punish of a pain day
 43| 66| are they wait except for the hour to come upon them suddenli while they perceiv not

 43| 89| so turn asid from them and say peac but they are go to know
 44|  1| ha meem

 44| 12| they will say our lord remov from us the torment inde we are believ

 44| 14| then they turn away from him and said he wa taught and is a madman
 44| 15| inde we will remov the torment for a littl inde you disbeliev will return to disbelief
 44| 16| the day we will strike with the greatest assault inde we will take retribut

 44| 27| and comfort wherein they were amus
 44| 28| thu and we caus to inherit it anoth peopl
 44| 29| and the heaven and earth wept not for them nor were they repriev
 44| 30| and we certainli save the children of israel from the humili torment
 44| 31| from pharaoh inde he wa a haughti one among the transgressor
 44| 32| and we certainli chose them by knowledg over all the world
 44| 33| and we gave them of sign that in which there wa a clear trial
 44| 34| inde these disbeliev are say
 44| 35| there is not but our first death and we will not be resurrect
 44| 36| then bring back our forefath if you should be truth
 44| 37| are they better or the peopl of tubba and those befor them we destroy them for inde they were crimin
 44| 38| and we did not creat the heaven and earth and that between them in play
 44| 39| we did not creat them except in truth but most of them do not know
 44| 40| inde the day of judgement is the appoint time for them all
 44| 41| the day when no relat will avail a relat at all nor will they be help
 44| 42| except those believ on whom allah ha merci inde he is the exalt in might the merci
 44| 43| inde the tree of zaqqum
 44| 44| is food for the sin
 44| 45| like murki oil it boil within belli
 44| 46| like the boil of scald water
 44| 47| it will be command seiz him and drag him into the midst of the hellfir
 44| 48| then pour over hi head from the torment of scald water
 44| 49| it will be said tast inde you are the honor the nobl
 44| 50| inde thi is what you use to disput
 44| 51| inde the righteou will be in a secur place
 44| 52| within garden and spring
 44| 53| wear garment of fine silk and brocad face each other
 44| 54| thu and we will marri them to fair women with larg beauti eye
 44| 55| they will call therein for everi kind of fruit safe and secur
 44| 56| they will not tast death therein except the first death and he will have protect them from the punish of hellfir
 44| 57| as bounti from your lord that is what is the great attain
 44| 58| and inde we have eas the quran in your tongu that they might be remind
 44| 59| so watch o muhammad inde they are watch for your end
 45|  1| ha meem
 45|  2| the revel of the book is from allah the exalt in might the wise
 45|  3| inde within the heaven and earth are sign for the believ
 45|  4| and in the creation of yourselv and what he dispers of move creatur are sign for peopl who are certain in faith
 45|  5| and in the altern of night and day and in what allah send down from the sky of provis and give life therebi to the earth after it lifeless and in hi direct of the wind are sign for a peopl who reason
 45|  6| these are the vers of allah which we recit to you in truth then in what statement after allah and hi vers will they believ
 45|  7| woe to everi sin liar
 45|  8| who hear the vers of allah recit to him then persist arrogantli as if he had not heard them so give him tide of a pain punish
 45|  9| and when he know anyth of our vers he take them in ridicul those will have a humili punish
 45| 10| befor them is hell and what they had earn will not avail them at all nor what they had taken besid allah as alli and they will have a great punish
 45| 11| thi quran is guidanc and those who have disbeliev in the vers of their lord will have a pain punish of foul natur
 45| 12| it is allah who subject to you the sea so that ship may sail upon it by hi command and that you may seek of hi bounti and perhap you will be grate
 45| 13| and he ha subject to you whatev is in the heaven and whatev is on the earth all from him inde in that are sign for a peopl who give thought
 45| 14| say o muhammad to those who have believ that they should forgiv those who expect not the day of allah so that he may recompens a peopl for what they use to earn
 45| 15| whoever doe a good deed it is for himself and whoever doe evil it is against the self then to your lord you will be return
 45| 16| and we did certainli give the children of israel the scriptur and judgement and prophethood and we provid them with good thing and prefer them over the world
 45| 17| and we gave them clear proof of the matter of religion and they did not differ except after knowledg had come to them out of jealou animos between themselv inde your lord will judg between them on the day of resurrect concern that over which they use to differ
 45| 18| then we put you o muhammad on an ordain way concern the matter of religion so follow it and do not follow the inclin of those who do not know
 45| 19| inde they will never avail you against allah at all and inde the wrongdoer are alli of one anoth but allah is the protector of the righteou
 45| 20| thi quran is enlighten for mankind and guidanc and merci for a peopl who are certain in faith
 45| 21| or do those who commit evil think we will make them like those who have believ and done righteou deed make them equal in their life and their death evil is that which they judg
 45| 22| and allah creat the heaven and earth in truth and so that everi soul may be recompens for what it ha earn and they will not be wrong
 45| 23| have you seen he who ha taken as hi god hi own desir and allah ha sent him astray due to knowledg and ha set a seal upon hi hear and hi heart and put over hi vision a veil so who will guid him after allah then will you not be remind
 45| 24| and they say there is not but our worldli life we die and live and noth destroy us except time and they have of that no knowledg they are onli assum
 45| 25| and when our vers are recit to them as clear evid their argument is onli that they say bring back our forefath if you should be truth
 45| 26| say allah caus you to live then caus you to die then he will assembl you for the day of resurrect about which there is no doubt but most of the peopl do not know
 45| 27| and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth and the day the hour appear that day the falsifi will lose
 45| 28| and you will see everi nation kneel from fear everi nation will be call to it record and told today you will be recompens for what you use to do
 45| 29| thi our record speak about you in truth inde we were have transcrib whatev you use to do
 45| 30| so as for those who believ and did righteou deed their lord will admit them into hi merci that is what is the clear attain
 45| 31| but as for those who disbeliev it will be said were not our vers recit to you but you were arrog and becam a peopl of crimin
 45| 32| and when it wa said inde the promis of allah is truth and the hour is come no doubt about it you said we know not what is the hour we assum onli assumpt and we are not convinc
 45| 33| and the evil consequ of what they did will appear to them and they will be envelop by what they use to ridicul
 45| 34| and it will be said today we will forget you as you forgot the meet of thi day of your and your refug is the fire and for you there are no helper
 45| 35| that is becaus you took the vers of allah in ridicul and worldli life delud you so that day they will not be remov from it nor will they be ask to appeas allah
 45| 36| then to allah belong all prais lord of the heaven and lord of the earth lord of the world
 45| 37| and to him belong all grandeur within the heaven and the earth and he is the exalt in might the wise
 46|  1| ha meem
 46|  2| the revel of the book is from allah the exalt in might the wise
 46|  3| we did not creat the heaven and earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specifi term but those who disbeliev from that of which they are warn are turn away
 46|  4| say o muhammad have you consid that which you invok besid allah show me what they have creat of the earth or did they have partnership in creation of the heaven bring me a scriptur reveal befor thi or a remain trace of knowledg if you should be truth
 46|  5| and who is more astray than he who invok besid allah those who will not respond to him until the day of resurrect and they of their invoc are unawar
 46|  6| and when the peopl are gather that day they who were invok will be enemi to them and they will be denier of their worship
 46|  7| and when our vers are recit to them as clear evid those who disbeliev say of the truth when it ha come to them thi is obviou magic
 46|  8| or do they say he ha invent it say if i have invent it you will not possess for me the power of protect from allah at all he is most know of that in which you are involv suffici is he as wit between me and you and he is the forgiv the merci
 46|  9| say i am not someth origin among the messeng nor do i know what will be done with me or with you i onli follow that which is reveal to me and i am not but a clear warner
 46| 10| say have you consid if the quran wa from allah and you disbeliev in it while a wit from the children of israel ha testifi to someth similar and believ while you were arrog inde allah doe not guid the wrongdo peopl
 46| 11| and those who disbeliev say of those who believ if it had truli been good they would not have preced us to it and when they are not guid by it they will say thi is an ancient falsehood
 46| 12| and befor it wa the scriptur of mose to lead and as a merci and thi is a confirm book in an arab tongu to warn those who have wrong and as good tide to the doer of good
 46| 13| inde those who have said our lord is allah and then remain on a right cours there will be no fear concern them nor will they griev
 46| 14| those are the companion of paradis abid etern therein as reward for what they use to do
 46| 15| and we have enjoin upon man to hi parent good treatment hi mother carri him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship and hi gestat and wean period is thirti month he grow until when he reach matur and reach the age of forti year he say my lord enabl me to be grate for your favor which you have bestow upon me and upon my parent and to work righteous of which you will approv and make righteou for me my offspr inde i have repent to you and inde i am of the muslim
 46| 16| those are the one from whom we will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misde their be among the companion of paradis that is the promis of truth which they had been promis
 46| 17| but one who say to hi parent uff to you do you promis me that i will be brought forth from the earth when gener befor me have alreadi pass on into oblivion while they call to allah for help and to their son woe to you believ inde the promis of allah is truth but he say thi is not but legend of the former peopl
 46| 18| those are the one upon whom the word ha come into effect who will be among nation which had pass on befor them of jinn and men inde they all were loser
 46| 19| and for all there are degre of reward and punish for what they have done and it is so that he may fulli compens them for their deed and they will not be wrong
 46| 20| and the day those who disbeliev are expos to the fire it will be said you exhaust your pleasur dure your worldli life and enjoy them so thi day you will be award the punish of extrem humili becaus you were arrog upon the earth without right and becaus you were defiantli disobedi
 46| 21| and mention o muhammad the brother of aad when he warn hi peopl in the region of alahqaf and warner had alreadi pass on befor him and after him say do not worship except allah inde i fear for you the punish of a terribl day
 46| 22| they said have you come to delud us away from our god then bring us what you promis us if you should be of the truth
 46| 23| he said knowledg of it time is onli with allah and i convey to you that with which i wa sent but i see you to be a peopl behav ignorantli
 46| 24| and when they saw it as a cloud approach their valley they said thi is a cloud bring us rain rather it is that for which you were impati a wind within it a pain punish
 46| 25| destroy everyth by command of it lord and they becam so that noth wa seen of them except their dwell thu do we recompens the crimin peopl
 46| 26| and we had certainli establish them in such as we have not establish you and we made for them hear and vision and heart but their hear and vision and heart avail them not from anyth of the punish when they were continu reject the sign of allah and they were envelop by what they use to ridicul
 46| 27| and we have alreadi destroy what surround you of those citi and we have diversifi the sign or vers that perhap they might return from disbelief
 46| 28| then whi did those they took besid allah as deiti by which to approach him not aid them but they had stray from them and that wa their falsehood and what they were invent
 46| 29| and mention o muhammad when we direct to you a few of the jinn listen to the quran and when they attend it they said listen quietli and when it wa conclud they went back to their peopl as warner
 46| 30| they said o our peopl inde we have heard a recit book reveal after mose confirm what wa befor it which guid to the truth and to a straight path
 46| 31| o our peopl respond to the messeng of allah and believ in him allah will forgiv for you your sin and protect you from a pain punish
 46| 32| but he who doe not respond to the caller of allah will not caus failur to him upon earth and he will not have besid him ani protector those are in manifest error
 46| 33| do they not see that allah who creat the heaven and earth and did not fail in their creation is abl to give life to the dead ye inde he is over all thing compet
 46| 34| and the day those who disbeliev are expos to the fire it will be said is thi not the truth they will say ye by our lord he will say then tast the punish becaus you use to disbeliev
 46| 35| so be patient o muhammad as were those of determin among the messeng and do not be impati for them it will be on the day they see that which they are promis as though they had not remain in the world except an hour of a day thi is notif and will ani be destroy except the defiantli disobedi peopl
 47|  1| those who disbeliev and avert peopl from the way of allah he will wast their deed
 47|  2| and those who believ and do righteou deed and believ in what ha been sent down upon muhammad and it is the truth from their lord he will remov from them their misde and amend their condit
 47|  3| that is becaus those who disbeliev follow falsehood and those who believ follow the truth from their lord thu doe allah present to the peopl their comparison
 47|  4| so when you meet those who disbeliev in battl strike their neck until when you have inflict slaughter upon them then secur their bond and either confer favor afterward or ransom them until the war lay down it burden that is the command and if allah had will he could have taken vengeanc upon them himself but he order arm struggl to test some of you by mean of other and those who are kill in the caus of allah never will he wast their deed
 47|  5| he will guid them and amend their condit
 47|  6| and admit them to paradis which he ha made known to them
 47|  7| o you who have believ if you support allah he will support you and plant firmli your feet
 47|  8| but those who disbeliev for them is miseri and he will wast their deed
 47|  9| that is becaus they dislik what allah reveal so he render worthless their deed
 47| 10| have they not travel through the land and seen how wa the end of those befor them allah destroy everyth over them and for the disbeliev is someth compar
 47| 11| that is becaus allah is the protector of those who have believ and becaus the disbeliev have no protector
 47| 12| inde allah will admit those who have believ and done righteou deed to garden beneath which river flow but those who disbeliev enjoy themselv and eat as graze livestock eat and the fire will be a resid for them
 47| 13| and how mani a citi wa stronger than your citi makkah which drove you out we destroy them and there wa no helper for them
 47| 14| so is he who is on clear evid from hi lord like him to whom the evil of hi work ha been made attract and they follow their own desir
 47| 15| is the descript of paradis which the righteou are promis wherein are river of water unalt river of milk the tast of which never chang river of wine delici to those who drink and river of purifi honey in which they will have from all kind of fruit and forgiv from their lord like that of those who abid etern in the fire and are given to drink scald water that will sever their intestin
 47| 16| and among them o muhammad are those who listen to you until when they depart from you they say to those who were given knowledg what ha he said just now those are the one of whom allah ha seal over their heart and who have follow their own desir
 47| 17| and those who are guid he increas them in guidanc and give them their righteous
 47| 18| then do they await except that the hour should come upon them unexpectedli but alreadi there have come some of it indic then what good to them when it ha come will be their remembr
 47| 19| so know o muhammad that there is no deiti except allah and ask forgiv for your sin and for the believ men and believ women and allah know of your movement and your rest place
 47| 20| those who believ say whi ha a surah not been sent down but when a precis surah is reveal and fight is mention therein you see those in whose heart is hypocrisi look at you with a look of one overcom by death and more appropri for them would have been
 47| 21| obedi and good word and when the matter of fight wa determin if they had been true to allah it would have been better for them
 47| 22| so would you perhap if you turn away caus corrupt on earth and sever your tie of relationship
 47| 23| those who do so are the one that allah ha curs so he deafen them and blind their vision
 47| 24| then do they not reflect upon the quran or are there lock upon their heart
 47| 25| inde those who revert back to disbelief after guidanc had becom clear to them satan entic them and prolong hope for them
 47| 26| that is becaus they said to those who dislik what allah sent down we will obey you in part of the matter and allah know what they conceal
 47| 27| then how will it be when the angel take them in death strike their face and their back
 47| 28| that is becaus they follow what anger allah and dislik what earn hi pleasur so he render worthless their deed
 47| 29| or do those in whose heart is diseas think that allah would never expos their feel of hatr
 47| 30| and if we will we could show them to you and you would know them by their mark but you will sure know them by the tone of their speech and allah know your deed
 47| 31| and we will sure test you until we make evid those who strive among you for the caus of allah and the patient and we will test your affair
 47| 32| inde those who disbeliev and avert peopl from the path of allah and oppos the messeng after guidanc had becom clear to them never will they harm allah at all and he will render worthless their deed
 47| 33| o you who have believ obey allah and obey the messeng and do not invalid your deed
 47| 34| inde those who disbeliev and avert peopl from the path of allah and then die while they were disbeliev never will allah forgiv them
 47| 35| so do not weaken and call for peac while you are superior and allah is with you and will never depriv you of the reward of your deed
 47| 36| thi worldli life is onli amus and divers and if you believ and fear allah he will give you your reward and not ask you for your properti
 47| 37| if he should ask you for them and press you you would withhold and he would expos your unwilling
 47| 38| here you are those invit to spend in the caus of allah but among you are those who withhold out of greed and whoever withhold onli withhold benefit from himself and allah is the free of need while you are the needi and if you turn away he will replac you with anoth peopl then they will not be the like of you
 48|  1| inde we have given you o muhammad a clear conquest
 48|  2| that allah may forgiv for you what preced of your sin and what will follow and complet hi favor upon you and guid you to a straight path
 48|  3| and that allah may aid you with a mighti victori
 48|  4| it is he who sent down tranquil into the heart of the believ that they would increas in faith along with their present faith and to allah belong the soldier of the heaven and the earth and ever is allah know and wise
 48|  5| and that he may admit the believ men and the believ women to garden beneath which river flow to abid therein etern and remov from them their misde and ever is that in the sight of allah a great attain
 48|  6| and that he may punish the hypocrit men and hypocrit women and the polytheist men and polytheist women those who assum about allah an assumpt of evil natur upon them is a misfortun of evil natur and allah ha becom angri with them and ha curs them and prepar for them hell and evil it is as a destin
 48|  7| and to allah belong the soldier of the heaven and the earth and ever is allah exalt in might and wise
 48|  8| inde we have sent you as a wit and a bringer of good tide and a warner
 48|  9| that you peopl may believ in allah and hi messeng and honor him and respect the prophet and exalt allah morn and afternoon
 48| 10| inde those who pledg allegi to you o muhammad they are actual pledg allegi to allah the hand of allah is over their hand so he who break hi word onli break it to the detriment of himself and he who fulfil that which he ha promis allah he will give him a great reward
 48| 11| those who remain behind of the bedouin will say to you our properti and our famili occupi us so ask forgiv for us they say with their tongu what is not within their heart say then who could prevent allah at all if he intend for you harm or intend for you benefit rather ever is allah with what you do acquaint
 48| 12| but you thought that the messeng and the believ would never return to their famili ever and that wa made pleas in your heart and you assum an assumpt of evil and becam a peopl ruin
 48| 13| and whoever ha not believ in allah and hi messeng then inde we have prepar for the disbeliev a blaze
 48| 14| and to allah belong the dominion of the heaven and the earth he forgiv whom he will and punish whom he will and ever is allah forgiv and merci
 48| 15| those who remain behind will say when you set out toward the war booti to take it let us follow you they wish to chang the word of allah say never will you follow us thu did allah say befor so they will say rather you envi us but in fact they were not understand except a littl
 48| 16| say to those who remain behind of the bedouin you will be call to face a peopl of great militari might you may fight them or they will submit so if you obey allah will give you a good reward but if you turn away as you turn away befor he will punish you with a pain punish
 48| 17| there is not upon the blind ani guilt or upon the lame ani guilt or upon the ill ani guilt for remain behind and whoever obey allah and hi messeng he will admit him to garden beneath which river flow but whoever turn away he will punish him with a pain punish
 48| 18| certainli wa allah pleas with the believ when they pledg allegi to you o muhammad under the tree and he knew what wa in their heart so he sent down tranquil upon them and reward them with an immin conquest
 48| 19| and much war booti which they will take and ever is allah exalt in might and wise
 48| 20| allah ha promis you much booti that you will take in the futur and ha hasten for you thi victori and withheld the hand of peopl from you that it may be a sign for the believ and that he may guid you to a straight path
 48| 21| and he promis other victori that you were so far unabl to realiz which allah ha alreadi encompass and ever is allah over all thing compet
 48| 22| and if those makkan who disbeliev had fought you they would have turn their back in flight then they would not find a protector or a helper

 51| 34| mark in the presenc of your lord for the transgressor
 51| 35| so we brought out whoever wa in the citi of the believ
 51| 36| and we found not within them other than a singl hous of muslim
 51| 37| and we left therein a sign for those who fear the pain punish
 51| 38| and in mose wa a sign when we sent him to pharaoh with clear author
 51| 39| but he turn away with hi support and said a magician or a madman
 51| 40| so we took him and hi soldier and cast them into the sea and he wa blameworthi
 51| 41| and in aad wa a sign when we sent against them the barren wind

 51| 44| but they were insol toward the command of their lord so the thunderbolt seiz them while they were look on
 51| 45| and they were unabl to aris nor could they defend themselv

 51| 48| and the earth we have spread out and excel is the prepar
 51| 49| and of all thing we creat two mate perhap you will rememb
 51| 50| so flee to allah inde i am to you from him a clear warner

 51| 52| similarli there came not to those befor them ani messeng except that they said a magician or a madman
 51| 53| did they suggest it to them rather they themselv are a transgress peopl
 51| 54| so leav them o muhammad for you are not to be blame
 51| 55| and remind for inde the remind benefit the believ
 51| 56| and i did not creat the jinn and mankind except to worship me
 51| 57| i do not want from them ani provis nor do i want them to feed me
 51| 58| inde it is allah who is the continu provid the firm possessor of strength
 51| 59| and inde for those who have wrong is a portion of punish like the portion of their predecessor so let them not impati urg me

 52| 26| they will say inde we were previous among our peopl fear of displeas allah
 52| 27| so allah confer favor upon us and protect us from the punish of the scorch fire
 52| 28| inde we use to supplic him befor inde it is he who is the benefic the merci
 52| 29| so remind o muhammad for you are not by the favor of your lord a soothsay or a madman
 52| 30| or do they say of you a poet for whom we await a misfortun of time
 52| 31| say wait for inde i am with you among the waiter
 52| 32| or do their mind command them to say thi or are they a transgress peopl
 52| 33| or do they say he ha made it up rather they do not believ
 52| 34| then let them produc a statement like it if they should be truth
 52| 35| or were they creat by noth or were they the creator of themselv
 52| 36| or did they creat the heaven and the earth rather they are not certain
 52| 37| or have they the depositori contain the provis of your lord or are they the control of them
 52| 38| or have they a stairway into the heaven upon which they listen then let their listen produc a clear author
 52| 39| or ha he daughter while you have son
 52| 40| or do you o muhammad ask of them a payment so they are by debt burden down
 52| 41| or have they knowledg of the unseen so they write it down
 52| 42| or do they intend a plan but those who disbeliev they are the object of a plan
 52| 43| or have they a deiti other than allah exalt is allah abov whatev they associ with him
 52| 44| and if they were to see a fragment from the sky fall they would say it is mere cloud heap up
 52| 45| so leav them until they meet their day in which they will be struck insens
 52| 46| the day their plan will not avail them at all nor will they be help
 52| 47| and inde for those who have wrong is a punish befor that but most of them do not know
 52| 48| and be patient o muhammad for the decis of your lord for inde you are in our eye and exalt allah with prais of your lord when you aris
 52| 49| and in a part of the night exalt him and after the set of the star
 53|  1| by the star when it descend
 53|  2| your companion muhammad ha not stray nor ha he er
 53|  3| nor doe he speak from hi own inclin
 53|  4| it is not but a revel reveal
 53|  5| taught to him by one intens in strength
 53|  6| one of sound and he rose to hi true form
 53|  7| while he wa in the higher part of the horizon
 53|  8| then he approach and descend
 53|  9| and wa at a distanc of two bow length or nearer
 53| 10| and he reveal to hi servant what he reveal
 53| 11| the heart did not lie about what it saw
 53| 12| so will you disput with him over what he saw
 53| 13| and he certainli saw him in anoth descent
 53| 14| at the lote tree of the utmost boundari
 53| 15| near it is the garden of refug
 53| 16| when there cover the lote tree that which cover it
 53| 17| the sight of the prophet did not swerv nor did it transgress it limit
 53| 18| he certainli saw of the greatest sign of hi lord
 53| 19| so have you consid allat and aluzza
 53| 20| and manat the third the other one
 53| 21| is the male for you and for him the femal
 53| 22| that then is an unjust divis
 53| 23| they are not but mere name you have name them you and your forefath for which allah ha sent down no author they follow not except assumpt and what their soul desir and there ha alreadi come to them from their lord guidanc
 53| 24| or is there for man whatev he wish
 53| 25| rather to allah belong the hereaft and the first life
 53| 26| and how mani angel there are in the heaven whose intercess will not avail at all except onli after allah ha permit it to whom he will and approv
 53| 27| inde those who do not believ in the hereaft name the angel femal name
 53| 28| and they have thereof no knowledg they follow not except assumpt and inde assumpt avail not against the truth at all
 53| 29| so turn away from whoever turn hi back on our messag and desir not except the worldli life
 53| 30| that is their sum of knowledg inde your lord is most know of who stray from hi way and he is most know of who is guid
 53| 31| and to allah belong whatev is in the heaven and whatev is in the earth that he may recompens those who do evil with the penalti of what they have done and recompens those who do good with the best reward
 53| 32| those who avoid the major sin and immor onli commit slight one inde your lord is vast in forgiv he wa most know of you when he produc you from the earth and when you were fetus in the womb of your mother so do not claim yourselv to be pure he is most know of who fear him
 53| 33| have you seen the one who turn away
 53| 34| and gave a littl and then refrain
 53| 35| doe he have knowledg of the unseen so he see
 53| 36| or ha he not been inform of what wa in the scriptur of mose
 53| 37| and of abraham who fulfil hi oblig
 53| 38| that no bearer of burden will bear the burden of anoth
 53| 39| and that there is not for man except that good for which he strive
 53| 40| and that hi effort is go to be seen
 53| 41| then he will be recompens for it with the fullest recompens
 53| 42| and that to your lord is the final
 53| 43| and that it is he who make one laugh and weep
 53| 44| and that it is he who caus death and give life
 53| 45| and that he creat the two mate the male and femal
 53| 46| from a spermdrop when it is emit
 53| 47| and that incumb upon him is the next creation
 53| 48| and that it is he who enrich and suffic
 53| 49| and that it is he who is the lord of siriu
 53| 50| and that he destroy the first peopl of aad
 53| 51| and thamud and he did not spare them
 53| 52| and the peopl of noah befor inde it wa they who were even more unjust and oppress
 53| 53| and the overturn town he hurl down
 53| 54| and cover them by that which he cover
 53| 55| then which of the favor of your lord do you doubt
 53| 56| thi prophet is a warner like the former warner
 53| 57| the approach day ha approach
 53| 58| of it from those besid allah there is no remov
 53| 59| then at thi statement do you wonder
 53| 60| and you laugh and do not weep
 53| 61| while you are proudli sport
 53| 62| so prostrat to allah and worship him
 54|  1| the hour ha come near and the moon ha split in two
 54|  2| and if they see a miracl they turn away and say pass magic
 54|  3| and they deni and follow their inclin but for everi matter is a time of settlement
 54|  4| and there ha alreadi come to them of inform that in which there is deterr
 54|  5| extens wisdom but warn doe not avail them
 54|  6| so leav them o muhammad the day the caller call to someth forbid
 54|  7| their eye humbl they will emerg from the grave as if they were locust spread
 54|  8| race ahead toward the caller the disbeliev will say thi is a difficult day
 54|  9| the peopl of noah deni befor them and they deni our servant and said a madman and he wa repel
 54| 10| so he invok hi lord inde i am overpow so help
 54| 11| then we open the gate of the heaven with rain pour down
 54| 12| and caus the earth to burst with spring and the water met for a matter alreadi predestin
 54| 13| and we carri him on a construct of plank and nail
 54| 14| sail under our observ as reward for he who had been deni
 54| 15| and we left it as a sign so is there ani who will rememb

 54| 23| thamud deni the warn
 54| 24| and said is it one human be among us that we should follow inde we would then be in error and mad
 54| 25| ha the messag been sent down upon him from among us rather he is an insol liar
 54| 26| they will know tomorrow who is the insol liar
 54| 27| inde we are send the shecamel as trial for them so watch them and be patient
 54| 28| and inform them that the water is share between them each day of drink attend by turn
 54| 29| but they call their companion and he dare and hamstrung her
 54| 30| and how sever were my punish and warn
 54| 31| inde we sent upon them one blast from the sky and they becam like the dri twig fragment of an anim pen
 54| 32| and we have certainli made the quran easi for remembr so is there ani who will rememb
 54| 33| the peopl of lot deni the warn
 54| 34| inde we sent upon them a storm of stone except the famili of lot we save them befor dawn
 54| 35| as favor from us thu do we reward he who is grate
 54| 36| and he had alreadi warn them of our assault but they disput the warn
 54| 37| and they had demand from him hi guest but we obliter their eye say tast my punish and warn
 54| 38| and there came upon them by morn an abid punish
 54| 39| so tast my punish and warn
 54| 40| and we have certainli made the quran easi for remembr so is there ani who will rememb
 54| 41| and there certainli came to the peopl of pharaoh warn

 54| 43| are your disbeliev better than those former one or have you immun in the scriptur
 54| 44| or do they say we are an assembl support each other
 54| 45| their assembl will be defeat and they will turn their back in retreat
 54| 46| but the hour is their appoint for due punish and the hour is more disastr and more bitter
 54| 47| inde the crimin are in error and mad
 54| 48| the day they are drag into the fire on their face it will be said tast the touch of saqar

 68|  2| you are not o muhammad by the favor of your lord a madman
 68|  3| and inde for you is a reward uninterrupt
 68|  4| and inde you are of a great moral charact
 68|  5| so you will see and they will see
 68|  6| which of you is the afflict by a devil
 68|  7| inde your lord is most know of who ha gone astray from hi way and he is most know of the rightli guid
 68|  8| then do not obey the denier
 68|  9| they wish that you would soften in your posit so they would soften toward you
 68| 10| and do not obey everi worthless habitu swearer
 68| 11| and scorner go about with malici gossip
 68| 12| a prevent of good transgress and sin

 68| 14| becaus he is a possessor of wealth and children
 68| 15| when our vers are recit to him he say legend of the former peopl
 68| 16| we will brand him upon the snout
 68| 17| inde we have tri them as we tri the companion of the garden when they swore to cut it fruit in the earli morn
 68| 18| without make except
 68| 19| so there came upon the garden an afflict from your lord while they were asleep
 68| 20| and it becam as though reap
 68| 21| and they call one anoth at morn
 68| 22| say go earli to your crop if you would cut the fruit
 68| 23| so they set out while lower their voic
 68| 24| say there will sure not enter it today upon you ani poor person
 68| 25| and they went earli in determin assum themselv abl
 68| 26| but when they saw it they said inde we are lost
 68| 27| rather we have been depriv
 68| 28| the most moder of them said did i not say to you whi do you not exalt allah
 68| 29| they said exalt is our lord inde we were wrongdoer
 68| 30| then they approach one anoth blame each other
 68| 31| they said o woe to us inde we were transgressor
 68| 32| perhap our lord will substitut for us one better than it inde we are toward our lord desir
 68| 33| such is the punish of thi world and the punish of the hereaft is greater if they onli knew
 68| 34| inde for the righteou with their lord are the garden of pleasur
 68| 35| then will we treat the muslim like the crimin
 68| 36| what is the matter with you how do you judg
 68| 37| or do you have a scriptur in which you learn
 68| 38| that inde for you is whatev you choos
 68| 39| or do you have oath bind upon us extend until the day of resurrect that inde for you is whatev you judg
 68| 40| ask them which of them for that claim is respons
 68| 41| or do they have partner then let them bring their partner if they should be truth
 68| 42| the day the shin will be uncov and they are invit to prostrat but the disbeliev will not be abl
 68| 43| their eye humbl humili will cover them and they use to be invit to prostrat while they were sound
 68| 44| so leav me o muhammad with the matter of whoever deni the quran we will progress lead them to punish from where they do not know
 68| 45| and i will give them time inde my plan is firm
 68| 46| or do you ask of them a payment so they are by debt burden down
 68| 47| or have they knowledg of the unseen so they write it down
 68| 48| then be patient for the decis of your lord o muhammad and be not like the companion of the fish when he call out while he wa distress
 68| 49| if not that a favor from hi lord overtook him he would have been thrown onto the nake shore while he wa censur
 68| 50| and hi lord chose him and made him of the righteou
 68| 51| and inde those who disbeliev would almost make you slip with their eye when they hear the messag and they say inde he is mad
 68| 52| but it is not except a remind to the world
 69|  1| the inevit realiti
 69|  2| what is the inevit realiti
 69|  3| and what can make you know what is the inevit realiti
 69|  4| thamud and aad deni the strike calam
 69|  5| so as for thamud they were destroy by the overpow blast
 69|  6| and as for aad they were destroy by a scream violent wind
 69|  7| which allah impos upon them for seven night and eight day in success so you would see the peopl therein fallen as if they were hollow trunk of palm tree
 69|  8| then do you see of them ani remain
 69|  9| and there came pharaoh and those befor him and the overturn citi with sin
 69| 10| and they disobey the messeng of their lord so he seiz them with a seizur exceed in sever
 69| 11| inde when the water overflow we carri your ancestor in the sail ship
 69| 12| that we might make it for you a remind and that a consciou ear would be consciou of it
 69| 13| then when the horn is blown with one blast
 69| 14| and the earth and the mountain are lift and level with one blow
 69| 15| then on that day the resurrect will occur
 69| 16| and the heaven will split open for that day it is infirm
 69| 17| and the angel are at it edg and there will bear the throne of your lord abov them that day eight of them
 69| 18| that day you will be exhibit for judgement not hidden among you is anyth conceal
 69| 19| so as for he who is given hi record in hi right hand he will say here read my record
 69| 20| inde i wa certain that i would be meet my account
 69| 21| so he will be in a pleasant life
 69| 22| in an elev garden
 69| 23| it fruit to be pick hang near
 69| 24| they will be told eat and drink in satisfact for what you put forth in the day past
 69| 25| but as for he who is given hi record in hi left hand he will say oh i wish i had not been given my record
 69| 26| and had not known what is my account
 69| 27| i wish my death had been the decis one
 69| 28| my wealth ha not avail me
 69| 29| gone from me is my author
 69| 30| allah will say seiz him and shackl him
 69| 31| then into hellfir drive him
 69| 32| then into a chain whose length is seventi cubit insert him
 69| 33| inde he did not use to believ in allah the most great
 69| 34| nor did he encourag the feed of the poor
 69| 35| so there is not for him here thi day ani devot friend
 69| 36| nor ani food except from the discharg of wound
 69| 37| none will eat it except the sinner
 69| 38| so i swear by what you see
 69| 39| and what you do not see
 69| 40| that inde the quran is the word of a nobl messeng
 69| 41| and it is not the word of a poet littl do you believ
 69| 42| nor the word of a soothsay littl do you rememb
 69| 43| it is a revel from the lord of the world
 69| 44| and if muhammad had made up about us some fals say
 69| 45| we would have seiz him by the right hand
 69| 46| then we would have cut from him the aorta
 69| 47| and there is no one of you who could prevent us from him
 69| 48| and inde the quran is a remind for the righteou
 69| 49| and inde we know that among you are denier
 69| 50| and inde it will be a caus of regret upon the disbeliev
 69| 51| and inde it is the truth of certainti
 69| 52| so exalt the name of your lord the most great
 70|  1| a supplic ask for a punish bound to happen
 70|  2| to the disbeliev of it there is no prevent
 70|  3| it is from allah owner of the way of ascent
 70|  4| the angel and the spirit will ascend to him dure a day the extent of which is fifti thousand year
 70|  5| so be patient with graciou patienc
 70|  6| inde they see it as distant
 70|  7| but we see it as near
 70|  8| on the day the sky will be like murki oil
 70|  9| and the mountain will be like wool
 70| 10| and no friend will ask anyth of a friend
 70| 11| they will be shown each other the crimin will wish that he could be ransom from the punish of that day by hi children
 70| 12| and hi wife and hi brother
 70| 13| and hi nearest kindr who shelter him
 70| 14| and whoever is on earth entir so then it could save him
 70| 15| no inde it is the flame of hell
 70| 16| a remov of exterior
 70| 17| it invit he who turn hi back on truth and went away from obedi
 70| 18| and collect wealth and hoard
 70| 19| inde mankind wa creat anxiou
 70| 20| when evil touch him impati
 70| 21| and when good touch him withhold of it
 70| 22| except the observ of prayer
 70| 23| those who are constant in their prayer
 70| 24| and those within whose wealth is a known right
 70| 25| for the petition and the depriv
 70| 26| and those who believ in the day of recompens

 83| 31| and when they return to their peopl they would return jest
 83| 32| and when they saw them they would say inde those are truli lost
 83| 33| but they had not been sent as guardian over them

 84| 22| but those who have disbeliev deni
 84| 23| and allah is most know of what they keep within themselv

 86|  3| it is the pierc star
 86|  4| there is no soul but that it ha over it a protector
 86|  5| so let man observ from what he wa creat
 86|  6| he wa creat from a fluid eject
 86|  7| emerg from between the backbon and the rib
 86|  8| inde allah to return him to life is abl

 86| 10| then man will have no power or ani helper
 86| 11| by the sky which return rain

 87| 13| neither die therein nor live
 87| 14| he ha certainli succeed who purifi himself
 87| 15| and mention the name of hi lord and pray

 88| 18| and at the sky how it is rais
 88| 19| and at the mountain how they are erect
 88| 20| and at the earth how it is spread out
 88| 21| so remind o muhammad you are onli a remind
 88| 22| you are not over them a control
 88| 23| howev he who turn away and disbeliev
 88| 24| then allah will punish him with the greatest punish
 88| 25| inde to us is their return
 88| 26| then inde upon us is their account
 89|  1| by the dawn
 89|  2| and by ten night

 89|  4| and by the night when it pass
 89|  5| is there not in all that an oath suffici for one of percept
 89|  6| have you not consid how your lord dealt with aad

 90| 13| it is the free of a slave
 90| 14| or feed on a day of sever hunger
 90| 15| an orphan of near relationship
 90| 16| or a needi person in miseri
 90| 17| and then be among those who believ and advis one anoth to patienc and advis one anoth to compass
